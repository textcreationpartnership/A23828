            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALTHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GH the <hi>Jews,</hi> by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking the Prophecies of Scripture concerning the Kingdom of their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> expected he ſhould have a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdom; and becauſe our Lord Jeſus was not for <hi>that,</hi> therefore they would not acknowledge him f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> their <hi>Meſſias;</hi> yet all things conſidered, there is no eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between our Religion and theirs. We own the very ſame God, whom they formerly Worſhipp'd, the Maker of the World, and their Lawgiver. We receive that very <hi>Meſſias</hi> whom God promiſed them by his Prophets, ſo many Ages before his coming. We own no other Spirit of God to have Inſpired the Apoſtles, beſides the Holy Ghoſt, who ſpoke by the Prophets, and by whoſe manifold Gifts the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:93550:3"/> be known, as one in whom all Nations ſhould be Bleſſed.</p>
            <p>This plainly appears in the way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which both Chriſt and his Apoſtles fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in preaching the Goſpel. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to take off the prejudices the <hi>then Jews</hi> laboured under, concerning the Nature of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Characters by which he was to be known: For they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued all along from the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and never propoſed any thing to their Diſciples but what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in thoſe Writings which the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged as the Standard of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which may be ſeen in Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe to the <hi>Jews, John v. 46.</hi> and to his Diſciples after his Reſurrection, <hi>Luke xxiv. 47,</hi> and <hi>44.</hi> in the words of St. <hi>Peter, Acts x. 43.</hi> and of St. <hi>Paul, Acts xxvi. 22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, in thoſe Sacred Books, although One only God be acknowledged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which denotes his Eſſence, and therefore is incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any other; yet not only that very Name is given to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but alſo all the Works, Attributes, and Characters, peculiar to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the only true God, are frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him.</p>
            <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:93550:3"/>
            <p>This the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors, as <hi>Philo</hi> and the <hi>Targumiſts,</hi> do readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For in their Expoſition of thoſe places of the Old Teſtament which relate to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they generally ſuppoſe him to be God; whereas the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> being of a far different Opinion, uſe all Shifts ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to evade the force of their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. The Apoſtles imitated in this the Synagogue, by applying to Chriſt ſeveral places of the Old Teſtament, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly were primarily intended of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe they ſometimes only touch at places of the Old Teſtament, without uſing them as formal Proofs of what they then handled; <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Diſciples have fancied that thoſe Citations out of the Old Teſtament, which are made uſe of by the Apoſtles, though they repreſent the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as being the ſame with the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet for all this are but bare Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions and Accommodations, made indeed by them to Subjects of a like nature, but not at all by them intended as Arguments and Demonſtrations.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more injurious to the Writings of the New Teſtament, than ſuch a Suppoſition: And there can hardly be an Opinion more apt to overthrow the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:93550:4"/> of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and to expoſe the Chriſtian Religion to the Scorn both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi> For the bare Accommodation of a place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot ſuppoſe that the Holy Ghoſt had any deſign in it, to intimate any thing ſounding that way, and conſequently the Senſe of that Scripture ſo accommodated is of no Authority. Whereas it is a moſt certain truth that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did deſign, by many of thoſe Quotations, to prove that which was in diſpute between them and the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what purpoſe ſhould Chriſt exhort the <hi>Jews to ſearch the Scriptures</hi> of the Old Teſtament, <hi>becauſe they teſtified of him,</hi> John <hi>v. 39.</hi> if thoſe Scriptures could only give a falſe Notion of him, by intimating that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed was the God of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> This were to ſuppoſe that Chriſt and his Apoſtles went about to prove a thing by that which had no Strength and no Authority to prove it: And that the Citations out of the Old Teſtament, are like the Works of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> who writ the Hiſtory of Chriſt in Verſes put together, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from <hi>Homer,</hi> under the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; or that of <hi>Proba Falconia,</hi> who did the ſame in Verſes and Words taken out of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="v" facs="tcp:93550:4"/>
            <p>It follows at leaſt from ſuch a Poſition, That in the Goſpel God gave a Revelation ſo very new, that it has no manner of Affinity to the Old, although he cauſed this old Revelation to be carefully writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Prophets, and as carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the <hi>Jews</hi> to be the Standard of their Faith, and the Ground of their Hopes, till he ſhould fulfil his Promiſes contained in it; and although Chriſt and his Apoſtles bid the <hi>Jews</hi> have recourſe to it, to know what they were to expect of God's promiſes.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Church ever rejected this pernicious Opinion. And although her firſt Champions againſt the Ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, did acknowledge that the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, brought in by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, had made the Doctrines much clearer then they were before, (which the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves do acknowledge, when they affirm, that hidden things are to be made plain to all by the <hi>Meſſias</hi>) yet they ever maintained that thoſe Doctrines were ſo clearly ſet down in the Books of the Old Teſtament, that they could not be oppoſed by them, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thoſe Books to come from God: eſpecially ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in told, that the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> when he
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:93550:5"/> came ſhould explain them, and make them clearer.</p>
            <p>This Obſervation is particularly of force againſt thoſe who formerly oppoſed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Bleſſed Trinity, and that of our Saviour's being God. Theſe Hereticks thought they followed the Opinion of the old <hi>Jews.</hi> Therefore they that confuted them, undertook to ſatisfy them, that the Chriſtian Church had received nothing from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, about thoſe two Articles, but what God had formerly taught the <hi>Jews,</hi> and what neceſſarily followed from the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; ſo that thoſe Doctrines could not be rejected, without accuſing the Divine Spirit, the Author of thoſe Books, of ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Thought, in not foreſeeing what naturally follows from thoſe Principles ſo often laid down and repeated by him.</p>
            <p>Theſe old Writers ſolidly proved to thoſe Hereticks, That God did teach the <hi>Jews</hi> the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of his Eſſence, yet ſo as to eſtabliſh at the ſame time a Diſtinction in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which according to the Notion which himſelf gives of it, we call Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And that when he promiſed that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come was to be Man, at the very ſame time he expreſly told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he was withal to be God bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:93550:5"/>
            <p>The force and evidence of the Proofs of thoſe Doctrines, is ſo great, and the Proofs themſelves ſo numerous, that Hereticks could not avoid them, but by ſetting up Opinions directly oppoſite to the Scriptures: On the other ſide, the Hereticks were ſo gravelled, that they broke into Opinions quite contrary one to another, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributed to confirm the Faith of them whom they oppoſed in thoſe Articles, ſo that it ſtill ſubſiſted; whereas the oppoſite Hereſies periſh'd in a manner as ſoon as broacht.</p>
            <p>The meanneſs of Chriſt, and his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death, moved the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> in the very firſt Age after him, to look upon him as a meer Man, though exalted by God's Grace to the Dignity of a Prophet. But the <hi>Cerinthians,</hi> another ſort of Hereticks, maintained that the <hi>Word</hi> did operate in him, though at the ſame time they denied the perſonal and inſeparable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of that Word with this human Nature.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Third Century, ſome had much ado to receive the Doctrine of the Trinity, by reaſon that they could not reconcile it with that of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God. But <hi>Praxeas, Noetus,</hi> and <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who oppoſed that Doctrine, were ſoon obliged to recant: And then from one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:93550:6"/> they ſhortly fell into another. For being ſatisfied that the Scripture does attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt, the divine Nature, which is conſtantly in the Old Teſtament expreſſed by the Name <hi>Jehovah;</hi> they undertook, contrary to the plain Notions of Scripture, to maintain, that there was but One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in God, which had appeared the ſame under three differing Names. Whereas ſome others did ſo plainly ſee the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Scripture makes between the Perſons, that they choſe rather to own Three diſtinct Eſſences, than to deny that there are Three Perſons in God, as the Scripture does invincibly prove.</p>
            <p>Two ſorts of Hereticks did formerly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Divinity of Chriſt. Some did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that, as to his divine Nature, he was before the World, and that by it he had made the World; though Himſelf, as to <hi>that nature,</hi> was created before the World; and theſe afterwards formed the <hi>Arian</hi> Sect. Others, but very few, ſuch as <hi>Artemas</hi> and <hi>Theodotus,</hi> denied that Chriſt was before he was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: They acknowledged in him no other beſides the human Nature, which, ſaid they, God had raiſed to a very high Dignity, by giving to it a Power almoſt infinite: And
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:93550:6"/> in this they made his Godhead to conſiſt.</p>
            <p>But theſe two ſorts of Hereticks were happily deſtroyed one by the other, for the <hi>Arians</hi> on the one ſide did confound <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temas</hi> his Diſciples, by proving from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, that Chriſt was before the Virgin, nay before the World. And on the other ſide, Abſurdity and Idolatry were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the <hi>Arians,</hi> both becauſe they acknowledged more than one divine Nature, and becauſe they worſhipped a Creature; whereas by the Chriſtian Religion, God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ought to be worſhipped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artemas</hi> his Diſciples were ſo few, and ſo ſeverely condemned, even whilſt the Church laboured under Perſecutions, that their Name is hardly remembred at this day; which clearly ſhews how ſtrange their Doctrine appeared to them who examined it by the Books of the Old and the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Arians,</hi> they made, it is true, more noiſe in the World, by the help of two or three of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Succeſſors, who by violent Methods endeavoured to ſpread their Opinion. But that very thing made their Sect odious, and in a little time quite ruined the credit of it. Within a hundred and fifty years, or thereabouts, after their firſt Riſe, there hardly remained any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:93550:7"/> of it; which plainly ſhews, that they could not anſwer thoſe Arguments from Scripture which were urged againſt them.</p>
            <p>I obſerve this laſt thing, that <hi>Arius</hi>'s Hereſy was deſtroyed by Proofs from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Eternal Divinity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, (though it was a long time countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, by the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> Kings in <hi>Africk,</hi> and by the Kings of the <hi>Goths</hi> both in <hi>Spain</hi> and in <hi>Italy;</hi>) leſt any ſhould fancy it was extinguiſhed only by Imperial Laws, and Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Beſides, that the firſt Inventors of that Hereſy had ſpread it before ſuch time as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by vanquiſhing <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius,</hi> became Maſter of the World. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall conſider that the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had, before <hi>Arius,</hi> already ſuffered ten Perſecutions without ſhrinking under them, will eaſily ſee that all the Power of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and of his Orthodox Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who puniſhed the <hi>Arian</hi> Profeſſors, had never been great enough to ſuppreſs their Opinion, if it had not been a Goſpel-doctrine: not to ſay that theſe Laws, and their Authority, extended no further than the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>What had happen'd in thoſe ancient Times, ſoon after the Chriſtian Church was eſtabliſht, happened likewiſe again in the
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:93550:7"/> laſt Century, at the Reformation of the Weſtern Church. As in thoſe early days there aroſe many Hereſies entirely oppoſite one to the other; ſo in theſe latter times the very ſame was ſeen among us. For when God raiſed up many Great Men to reform the Church in this and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Kingdoms, there appeared ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Men, who being weary of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Tyranny, both in Doctrine and Worſhip, did fancy that they might make a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Reformation, if they could remove out of the Chriſtian Religion thoſe things which human Reaſon was apt to ſtumble at. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Church having obtruded upon her Votaries ſuch Myſteries as were directly repugnant to Reaſon, they imagined that the Doctrines of the Trinity, and of Chriſt's Divinity, were of that number; and thus uſed all their Endeavours to prove that they were abſurd and contradictory.</p>
            <p>Had not theſe Doctrines been grounded on the Authority of the Books of the Old and the New Teſtament, they might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough have confuted them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to own the Authority of thoſe Books, which they durſt not attack for fear of being deteſted by all Chriſtians, they fell into the ſame oppoſite Extremes, into which thoſe Hereticks of old had
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:93550:8"/> fallen, when they oppoſed theſe fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity; and thus were as divided: in Opinions about thoſe matters, as the ancient Hereticks had been before them.</p>
            <p>For whilſt ſome of them, as <hi>Laelius So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> denied the Divinity of Chriſt, and thus revived the Opinion of <hi>Artemas</hi> and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; others ſeeing how abſurd the Anſwers were that <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Followers gave to thoſe places of Scripture, which aſſert the Trinity, and the Divinity of Chriſt, run ſo far to the contrary of this <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſy, that they acknowledged three Gods. And not only the Adverſaries of <hi>Socinus,</hi> but even ſome of his Diſciples did oppoſe his Opinion, moved thereto by the Authority of Scripture. For he held it a fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Faith, that Chriſt is to be adored; in which he was a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Idolater, in adoring Chriſt as true God, when he believed Chriſt to be a meer Creature. But his Diſciples building upon this firm Maxim of Scripture, that God alone is to be adored, juſtly concluded againſt him that he was not to be adored, ſince ſtrictly ſpeaking he was but a Creature, and no God.</p>
            <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:93550:8"/>
            <p>This Diviſion was plainly occaſioned by the ſtrength of Scripture-proofs, which on the one hand clearly ſhew, that none can be a Chriſtian without adoring Chriſt; and on the other poſitively affirm, that none but the True God ought to be adored. Thus theſe two oppoſite Parties did unwillingly do the buſineſs of the true Church, which ever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Enemies of the Trinity, and of the Godhead of Chriſt, the Authority of the Holy Scripture, which teaches that Chriſt ought to be adored, and withal convinces the <hi>Arians</hi> of Idolatry, who adored Chriſt without owning him to be the true God, though they beſtowed on him a kind of a Godhead inferior to that of the Father.</p>
            <p>I cannot but admire, that they who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few years have in this Kingdom embraced <hi>Socinus</hi> his Opinions, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider no better how little ſucceſs they have had elſewhere againſt the truth, and that upon the ſcore of their Diviſions, which will unavoidably follow, till they can agree in unanimouſly rejecting the Authority of Scripture. Neither doth it avail them any thing to uſe Quibbles and Evaſions, and weak Conjectures, ſince they are often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably confuted even by ſome of their Brethren, who are more dextrous than they in expounding of Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:93550:9"/>
            <p>But being reſolved by all means to defend their Tenents, ſome Chief men amongſt them have undertaken to ſet aſide the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scriptures, which is ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them: And the Author of a late Book, intitled, <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> maintains that the Goſpels have been corrupted by the Orthodox Party, and ſuſpects that of St. <hi>John</hi> to be the work of <hi>Cerinthus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no very eaſy Task to diſpute againſt men whoſe Principles are ſo uncertain, and who in a manner have no regard to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture. It was much leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to undertake <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf, becauſe he owned however the Authority of Scripture, and that it had not been corrupted. But one knows not how to deal with his Diſciples, who in their Opinion ſeem to be ſo contrary to him, and one another.</p>
            <p>They do now affirm the adoration which is paid to Chriſt is Idolatrous, thus renouncing <hi>Socinus</hi> his Principles, who lookt upon it as an eſſential piece of Chriſtianity. So that they can no longer be called <hi>Socinians,</hi> and themſelves affect the name of <hi>Unitarians:</hi> And as their chief buſineſs ſeems to be to accuſe the ſincerity of Scripture-writers, ſo the main work of them who undertake to confute them, muſt be the eſtabliſhing both the Sincerity and Authority of it, which is
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:93550:9"/> no very hard task: For even <hi>Mahometans,</hi> though they take ſome of the ſame Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> are ſo full of, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Divinity of Chriſt, yet are ſo far from accuſing Chriſtians of having cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Scripture, that they furniſh us with Weapons againſt the <hi>Unitarians</hi> of this Kingdom, as the Reader will find at the end of this following Book.</p>
            <p>And although there be but ſmall hopes of bringing to right again Men of ſo ſtrange Diſpoſitions and Notions, yet they ought by no means to be left to themſelves. They have been often confuted by them that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from the bare Principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that is, the Authority of Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, which are the very Word of God. And it has been plainly ſhewed them that what Alterations ſoever they have made in <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Opinions, yet their new Conceits are neither more Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than his, nor more agreeable to Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>I ſay that their Opinions are not more agreeable than his to right Reaſon. For when all is done, to affirm, That Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God an Infinite Power to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World, without being eſſentially God, is to affirm a downright Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> that without partaking of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:93550:10"/> Eſſence he received one of the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which are Eſſential to God.</p>
            <p>It is true, ſome Popiſh Divines allow the Soul of Chriſt to be all-knowing, by reaſon of its immediate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; wherein they do much ſervice to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in holding as they do that a Creature is capable of receiving ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. But Proteſtant Divines reject this Notion as altogether falſe, as falſe as many of the Schoolmens Speculations, even the abſurdeſt of them that are exploded by the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have been alſo further refuted as to what they aver, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was the firſt that taught the Doctrines of the Trinity, of Chriſt's Eternal Godhead, and of his Incarnation.</p>
            <p>And at laſt, that Learned Divine Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> having obſerved, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tradition was favourable to thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of which the <hi>Socinians</hi> make <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> to have been the firſt Broacher. Howſoever <hi>M. N.</hi> treats him for this, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a Scholar, nor a Chriſtian, I ſhall venture his diſpleaſure in making out this Obſervation, without meddling at all with his Arguments drawn from the Fathers, to ſhew clearly, that the like Exceptions of <hi>M. N.</hi> againſt <hi>Philo,</hi> as being a <hi>Platonick,</hi>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:93550:10"/> and againſt the Ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Tradition, can help him no way in the Cauſe he has taken in hand.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of our Church being the ſame which was taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it will be an eaſy matter to prove it by the ſame places of Scripture by which Chriſt and his Apoſtles converted the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> over to the Chriſtian Faith; and by which the Hereticks were confuted, who followed or renewed the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which the <hi>Jews</hi> have fallen into ſince Chriſtianity begun.</p>
            <p>But I will go farther, and prove, that the Ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church yield the ſame Principles which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles builded upon, and by this Method it will plainly appear, That the <hi>Socinians</hi> or the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> let them call themſelves what they pleaſe, muſt either abſolutely renounce the Authority of Scripture, and turn downright <hi>Deiſts,</hi> or they muſt own thoſe Doctrines of the Trinity, and the Divinity of Chriſt, as being taught us by God himſelf in the Holy Scriptures, and acknowledged by the Ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>

               <p>IF the Doctrines of the Ever-Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and of the Promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> being very God, had been altogether unknown to the <hi>Jews,</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt began to preach the Goſpel, it would be a great prejudice againſt the Chriſtian Religion. But the contrary being once ſatisfactorily made out, will go a great way towards proving thoſe Doctrines among Chriſtians. The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> are ſo ſenſible of this, that they give their Cauſe for loſt if this be admitted: And therefore they have uſed their utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93550:14"/> to weaken, or at leaſt to bring under ſuſpicion, the Arguments by which this may be proved.</p>
               <p>It is now about ſixty years ago ſince one of that Sect writ a Latin Tract about the meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſes, in Anſwer to <hi>Wechner,</hi> who had proved that St. <hi>John</hi> uſed this word in the firſt Chapter of his Goſpel, in the ſame ſenſe that the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſes had uſed it before Chriſt's time; and conſequently, that it is to be underſtood of a Perſon properly ſo called in the Bleſſed Trinity: which way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting that word, becauſe it directly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine, which was then, that St. <hi>John</hi> by the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, underſtood no other than Chriſt as Man, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this Author uſed all his Wit and Learning to evade it.</p>
               <p>The Conſtruction which <hi>Socinus</hi> put upon the firſt Chapter of the Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> was then followed generally by his Diſciples. But ſome years ſince, they have ſet it aſide here, as being abſurd and impertinent. And they now freely own what that <hi>Socinian</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſtrongly oppoſed, That the <hi>Word</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by St. <hi>John</hi> is the eternal and eſſential Vertue of God, by which he made the World, and operated in the Perſon of Chriſt. Only they deny that <hi>Word</hi> to be a Perſon diſtinct from the Father, as we do affirm. And whereas <hi>Socinus</hi> taught, That Chriſt was made God, and therefore is a proper Object of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip; now the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> who believe him to be no other than a meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creature, following the Principles of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93550:14"/> Chriſtianity better than <hi>Socinus,</hi> condemn the Religious Worſhip which is paid to him.</p>
               <p>As they do believe, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had the ſame Notions of the Godhead and Perſon of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> which they have themſelves, ſo they think they have done the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion an extraordinary ſervice in thus rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it of this double Difficulty, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Converſion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Mr. <hi>N.</hi> one of their ableſt Men, having read <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s Dialogue with <hi>Trypho,</hi> in which <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi> ſays, that he did not believe that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> was to be other than Man, makes uſe of this Paſſage of <hi>Trypho</hi> for proof, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Divinity of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and by conſequence of the Trinity, were never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the <hi>Jews.</hi> This he does in a Book, the Title whereof is, <hi>The Judgment of the Fathers againſt Dr.</hi> Bull.</p>
               <p>His deſign being to prove, that <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> about 140 years after Chriſt, was the firſt that held the Doctrine of Chriſt's Divinity, and by conſequence that of the Trinity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the other cannot be defended; he found it neceſſary to aſſert,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. That ſince the <hi>Jews,</hi> by <hi>Trypho</hi>'s Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, did own the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to be nothing more than meer Man, therefore the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors, quoted by Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> againſt the <hi>Socinian</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, muſt have lived after the Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, That the Books that are quoted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, were written by Chriſtians in Maſquerade, that lived ſince <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s time: And this he applies in particular to the Works of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and to the Book of <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93550:15"/>3dy. That ſince the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors could not poſſibly mention any thing like the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Trinity, and of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> his being God too, to which they were ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Strangers; whatſoever occurrs in any of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Books, that favours thoſe Doctrines, muſt needs have been foiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by Chriſtians after <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he ſuppoſes, That if any thing, either in the Scripture or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors, ſounds that way, it probably came from the <hi>Platonics,</hi> of whom both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> borrowed many Notions, and mixed them with Chriſtian Doctrines, to perſwade the <hi>Heathens</hi> the more eaſily to embrace the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>Now though it ſeems unneceſſary to diſpute any further againſt him, having already clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn, in my Diſcuſſion of Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fathers, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was not the Broacher of thoſe Doctrines, as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> pretends; yet I am willing to give a more full ſatisfaction to the World about it, by examining what either Mr. <hi>N.</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſaid or can ſay on this Subject, and ſhewing that the bold Anſwers to Dr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s Proofs concerning the Opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt about thoſe Doctrines, are no better than Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s ſuppoſition, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was the firſt that maintained thoſe Doctrines.</p>
               <p>I was particularly induced to undertake this task, in hopes that by examining this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the bottom, I might ſet theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in their true Light; ſhewing how little
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93550:15"/> credit ſome Divines do deſerve, who playing the Criticks, have favoured the new <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi> with all their Might, and abuſe thoſe who upon ſuch ungrounded Authority too raſhly believe, that theſe Fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity came from the School of <hi>Plato;</hi> when on the contrary it is certain, that <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf, by converſing with the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> borrowed of them his beſt Notions of God.</p>
               <p>To do this in the beſt method I can, I will firſt of all conſider in general, what the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tradition was before Chriſt: Let the Reader give me leave to uſe that word as the Fathers commonly uſe it; not for a Doctrine unknown in Scripture, but for a Doctrine drawn from Scripture, and acknowledged for the Common Faith of the Church; and I ſhall ſhew, That both before Chriſt, and in his time, the <hi>Jews</hi> had a current way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Old Teſtament, which they had received from their Fathers; and that Chriſt and his Apoſtles uſed and approved this way of expounding their Scriptures in many particulars.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. I will examine the Grounds the <hi>Jews</hi> went upon, to come to the underſtanding of the Old Teſtament, particularly of that part which contains the Promiſes of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as they had it in Chriſt's time, and ſtill have it to this day.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. I will ſhew by ſome Examples, That Chriſt and his Apoſtles did prove many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Doctrine by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, commonly received among the <hi>Jews;</hi> which they would hardly have done,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93550:16"/> had they had nothing elſe of their ſide, but only the Letter of thoſe places which they quoted.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed in general as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Foundation, I ſhall particularly examine the Authority of the Apocryphal Books of the Old Teſtament, and of the Books of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> that are extant, and of the <hi>Targum</hi> or the <hi>Caldaick</hi> Paraphraſes on the Books of the Old Teſtament; theſe being the chief Helps by which we may find out the <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſenſe</hi> of the Old Teſtament as it was received in the Synagogue before Chriſt's time. This is abſolutely neceſſary to be done; for without proving the Authority of thoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Books, of <hi>Philo,</hi> and of thoſe Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we cannot with any force and weight uſe their Teſtimony in this Controverſy, as I intend to do.</p>
               <p>This being diſpatcht, I ſhall prove clearly, That the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt's time, according to the received Expoſitions of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, derived from their Fathers, had a Notion of a Plurality of Perſons in the Unity of the Divine Eſſence; And that this Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was a Trinity. And further, That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what Mr. <hi>N.</hi> has imagined, the moſt learned amongſt them have conſtantly retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Notions, though perhaps they were divided in their Opinions about the <hi>Meſſias</hi> his Godhead, and the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as we do apprehend it.</p>
               <p>And becauſe, if it be granted that the Word was a Perſon, that goes a great way toward proving the Doctrine of the Trinity; And the <hi>Socinians</hi> affirm, that it was not the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93550:16"/> uncreated Word, but a created Angel, that appeared to Men under the Old Teſtament-diſpenſation, and was adored as being God's Repreſentative; I ſhall enquire what was the Opinion of the Old <hi>Jews</hi> concerning theſe Matters; and ſhew, that they owned the Word to be a Divine Perſon; and that it was that Word that appeared in the Old Teſtament; and conſequently, that nothing is more falſe than what ſome <hi>Socinians</hi> teach after <hi>Grotius</hi> (upon the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ch. 18.15.) grounding it upon his Opinion of an Angel's appearing and being adored; That therefore it was lawful for the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old Teſtament to worſhip Angels; but it was firſt forbidden to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under the New; as namely, by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Coloſ. 11.18.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Socinians</hi> may have nothing left them to reply againſt this, I ſhall deſcend to particulars, and ſhew at large, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the Old Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, the <hi>Jews</hi> apprehended the <hi>Word</hi> as a true and proper Perſon; and held, that that <hi>Word</hi> was the Son of God; That he was the true God; That he was to be in the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was promiſed under the Old Teſtament, as <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and accordingly the Old Synagogue expected that he ſhould be <hi>Jehovah</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>It is of great moment to ſatisfy the World of theſe Truths, and to make the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſenſible, that they can't truly profeſs the Chriſtian Religion without owning thoſe Doctrines, to which yet they ſeem to be ſo averſe. Therefore I will go farther, and diſtinctly ſhew, that the whole Goſpel is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93550:17"/> grounded on thoſe very Notions which the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt entertained. That the firſt Chriſtians after the Apoſtles exactly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them; And that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, following generally thoſe very Notions upon the chief Texts of the Old Teſtament which Chriſtians quote in thoſe Controverſies, bear witneſs, that they were the undoubted Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines both of them and of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>The Men that we have to do with, do very confidently affirm any thing that comes into their heads, be it never ſo little proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo they may thereby give any plauſible Solutions of the Difficulties in which they find themſelves entangled and perplext: and they are much given to vaunt of their unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arguments, ſo they call them, which are many times but weak Objections, ſuch as Men of Learning and Wit ſhould be aſhamed of.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon I thought it neceſſary to prevent, as far as it was poſſible, all that they can object againſt my Poſition of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Old <hi>Jews</hi> held concerning thoſe Doctrines, which were exactly followed and fully declared by the Apoſtles and firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And becauſe I foreſee ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may ariſe, I will ſhew, that nothing can be more abſurd, than to imagine, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> borrowed their Notions about the Trinity, or the Divinity of Chriſt, from <hi>Plato</hi>'s Diſciples; whereas <hi>Plato</hi> hath in truth followed the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Notions of thoſe things.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93550:17"/>
               <p>After this, I ſhall make it appear, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome of the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Opinions in theſe Articles, yet the <hi>Socinians</hi> can make no advantage thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> have in reality much alter'd their belief ſince Chriſt's time, and are guilty of great Diſingenuity, as is common to all thoſe who are obſtinately ſet upon the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of erroneous Doctrines.</p>
               <p>In fine, I ſhall plainly ſhew, that the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> to defend themſelves againſt the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, have been forced to imitate thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Jews,</hi> and have much out done them in changing and ſhifting their Opinions when they diſpute with Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I hope to manage this Controverſy with the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſo plainly and fully, as to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Reader, That as on the one ſide they moſt falſly accuſe the Church of having cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the New Teſtament to favour the Doctrines of the Trinity, and of Chriſt's God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; So they cannot on the other ſide get any ground upon the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Diſputes with them, though they fancy they got a great way towards their Converſion by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting thoſe Doctrines.</p>
               <p>In a word, both the Ancient and Modern <hi>Jews</hi> do ſo far agree in thoſe things which make on the Church's ſide againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that if they appeal to the <hi>Jews,</hi> they are ſure to loſe their Cauſe; which when they have better conſidered, they will find it their beſt way for the maintaining of their Opinions to abandon the <hi>Jews</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Men that underſtood not their own Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> the Old Teſtament, and to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93550:18"/> reject both, as they have gone a great way towards it, in rejecting that <hi>traditional ſenſe</hi> of the Old Teſtament, for which it was quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the New; and without which it would have ſignified little or nothing to thoſe purpoſes for which it was quoted. And ſo it will appear that for all their brags of the Aptneſs, and even Neceſſity of their way for the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the direct way to harden them, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up that ſenſe of the Old Teſtament Scriptures which Chriſt and his Apoſtles made uſe of for the converting of their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>But we have the leſs reaſon to complain of them for this, when we ſee how apt they are to queſtion the Authority of the Books of the New Teſtament, as oft as they find them ſo clearly oppoſite to their Doctrines, that they cannot obſcure the Light of them by any tolerable Expoſition. To ſhew that I do not ſay this without cauſe, I ſhall ſhow ſome inſtances in the laſt Chapter of this Book.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub"> That in the times of Jeſus Chriſt our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, the <hi>Jews</hi> had among them a common Explication of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, grounded on the Tradition of their Fathers, which was in many things approved by Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Jews</hi> have to this day a certain kind of Tradition received from their Forefathers, which contain many precepts of things to be done or avoided on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Religion. This they call their Oral Law; by which name they diſtinguiſh it from the written Law, which God gave them by <hi>Moſes.</hi> They make five Orders of ſuch a Tradition, which are explained by <hi>Moſes de Trano in</hi> his <hi>Kiriat Sepher,</hi> Printed at <hi>Venice, Anno</hi> 1551. The firſt is, of the things which they infer from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets by a clear conſequence, and they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of the ſame Authority as the reſt of the Revelation, although they call it a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. We are not ſuch Enemies to Names as not to like ſuch a ſort of Tradition, and we receive it with all imaginable reverence; we like very well the Judgment of <hi>Maimonides</hi> who leaves as uncertain whatſoever the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors ſpeak upon many things, as being without ground when their Tradition is not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93550:19"/> gathered from Texts of Scripture, <hi>de Regib. c.</hi> 12. The ſecond Order is of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Rites, which they keep, as coming from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> but of which there is not a word in the Law. The third Order is of the Judiciary Laws upon which the two Schools of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Shammai</hi> were divided. The fourth is of ſome Conſtitutions of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, which they look upon as an hedge to the Law. The laſt is of their Cuſtoms, which are various in ſeveral places of their diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Tho' in many things they cannot but ſee that thoſe laſt four Orders of Tradition do not agree with the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or are quite unknown in it, yet they ſeem to like it never the worſe. Nay, their Rabbins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly aſcribe a much greater Authority to this Oral Law, than to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> They ſay in the <hi>Talmud Avoda zara, c.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. that a Man who ſtudies in the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without theſe Traditions, is a Man which is without God; according to the Prophecy of <hi>Azariah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 15.3. Of this ſort were all the Traditions which were condemned by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: He plainly calls them <hi>the Commandments of Men,</hi> Mat. XV. 9. and has purpoſely directed ſeveral of his Diſcourſes againſt them; becauſe even where their obſerving theſe Traditions would not conſiſt with their Obedience to God, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the caſe of <hi>Corban,</hi> Mat. XV. 3. yet they gave Tradition the preference, and ſo as our Saviour there tells them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>They made the Commandments of God of no effect by their Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93550:19"/>
               <p>The Author of theſe Traditions, or new Laws, as one may term them, did almoſt all of them live ſince the time that the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the power of the <hi>Seleucidae;</hi> and they were the Leaders of thoſe ſeveral Sects that corrupted their Religion, by adding to it a great number of Obſervations which were perfectly new. We have therefore no reaſon to look upon this ſort of Tradition, as the fountain from whence the <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's time took their meaſures of the ſenſe and meaning of the Writings of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>But for the Interpreting of their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's time had ſome other kinds of Traditions, much different from thoſe which Chriſt ſo ſeverely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And theſe I ſhall explain more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, giving ſome examples of their uſe, and alſo of their Authority.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They had by Tradition the knowledge of ſome Matters of fact, which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in their Scriptures; and of other things they had more perfect and minute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, than are recorded in the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Particularly <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> writing of the Life of <hi>Moſes,</hi> declares that what he had to ſay of him, was taken partly out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and partly received by Tradition from their Forefathers<note n="*" place="margin">De vita Moſis pag. <hi>468.</hi> Edit. Genev. Ib. p <hi>470.</hi> F.</note>. Of this latter ſort was the long account he there gives of <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought up in all the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> for there is nothing of this in the Old Teſtament. Therefore when St. <hi>Stephen</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:93550:20"/> ſays the ſame thing, <hi>Act.</hi> VII. 22. we know that he alſo had it not from Scripture, but from Tradition.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the names of <hi>Jannes and Jambres,</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians that <hi>reſiſted Moſes and the Truth,</hi> 2 Tim. iv. 8. for their names are no where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but they are in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> i. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> vii. 11. from whence alſo they are taken into <hi>Talmud Sanhedrin</hi>

                  <hi>c.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew that the Pot wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> laid up the Manna, was made of Gold, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 4. which alſo the Seventy and <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew [de congr. quaer. er. gr. pag.</hi> 375. <hi>Ed. Gen.</hi>] do aſſure us of.<note place="margin">Mechil. fol. <hi>20.</hi> Col. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; Tanchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, fol. <hi>29.</hi> Col. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> And tho' the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> deny this, and ſay the Pot was of Earth; yet it is acknowledg'd by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> that is was Golden. This muſt have been from Tradition, becauſe there is no ſuch thing ſaid in Scripture.</p>
               <p>It was from hence that the Apoſtle had that ſaying of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſaw the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appearance of God upon Mount <hi>Sinai, Heb.</hi> xii. 21. <hi>So terrible was the ſight, that Moſes ſaid, I exceedingly fear and quake.</hi> And another that writ ſoon after <hi>Paul</hi>'s death, namely <hi>Clemens</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, cap.</hi> 17. has other like words that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am the Steam upon the Pot.</hi> Both theſe ſayings being no where in Scripture, they could not have known them otherwiſe than from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tradition.</p>
               <p>From hence alſo St. <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 9. had that paſſage of the diſpute that <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel had with the Devil about the Body of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Which Body, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> probably
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93550:20"/> ſays, [<hi>Ant.</hi> iv. 8.] if any Relick of it had been kept, would have drawn the people into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. That paſſage, we are told by ſome of the Fathers, was taken out of an <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Book call'd the <hi>Analepſis</hi> of <hi>Moſes, [Clem. Alex. in Jud. &amp; Origen. peri Archon.</hi> iii. 2.] <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us the <hi>Jews</hi> have the like things in their <hi>Midraſh</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> in the <hi>Aboth</hi> of <hi>R. Nathan,</hi> and in other of their Books.</p>
               <p>It was from hence that St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood that ſome of the <hi>Prophets were ſawn aſunder,</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93550:21"/> in the Captivity, or in the bloody Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, long before the time of our Bleſſed Saviour and his Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who lived in that Age, and writ the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews,</hi> makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and gives a very lame account of the things which paſſed under ſeveral Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Beſides the Canonical Books, they had Writings of a leſs Authority, wherein were inſerted by the great Men of their Nation, ſeveral Doctrines that came from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which were in very high eſteem and veneration, though not regarded as of equal Authority with the Writings of the Prophets. It is not improbable that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> had reſpect to ſome Book of this nature, when he quoted that which is not found in expreſs words in any of the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be <hi>called a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene, Mat.</hi> ii. 23. if he doth not allude to the Idea of the <hi>Jews</hi> who referred to the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> the <hi>Netzer,</hi> or Branch ſpoken of by <hi>Iſa.</hi> xi. 1. So Chriſt himſelf may ſeem to have alluded to a paſſage in one of theſe Books, <hi>Joh.</hi> vii. 38. where he ſaith, <hi>He that believeth on me, as ſaith the Scripture, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water;</hi> for there is nothing perfectly like this in any of the Canonical Books that are come to our hands.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, as <hi>Jerom</hi> [in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> v. 14.] obſerves, has cited divers ſuch Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books, accommodating himſelf, no doubt, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who gave much defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Authority. Thus he did, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 21. and perhaps in ſome other places of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93550:21"/> his Epiſtles, from the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is ſtill extant in our Bibles. Elſewhere he has Quotations out of Books that are loſt, as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 9. out of an Apocryphal Book that went under the name of the Prophet <hi>Elias;</hi> and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> v. 14. out of an Apocryphal piece of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> as we are told by <hi>Georgius Syncellus</hi> in his <hi>Chron. p.</hi> 27. A. But the moſt expreſs Quotation of this kind, is that which is alledged by <hi>St. James</hi> iv. 5, 6. For theſe words, <hi>The ſpirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to Envy,</hi> are not in any Books of the Old Teſtament; nor are the following words, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> And yet both theſe ſayings are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Scripture by the Holy Apoſtle. Of the firſt he ſaith plainly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Scripture ſaith,</hi> Then he goes on to the other, and of that he ſaith alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without any Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Caſe but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> before mentioned, which implies that the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith this alſo. Now what Scripture could he mean? for it is certain, that neither of theſe ſayings is any where elſe in our Scriptures. He muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mean it of one or other of the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books. And one of the Fathers that was born within a hundred years after his death, gives us a very probable gueſs at the Book that he intended. It is <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> who ſaith of the latter Quotation, Theſe are the <hi>words of Moſes, Strom.</hi> iv. <hi>p.</hi> 376. meaning in all likelihood of the Analepſis of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which Book is mentioned by the ſame <hi>Clement</hi> elſewhere on <hi>Jude v.</hi> 9. as a Book well known in thoſe times in which he lived. Therefore in all likelihood the words alſo of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93550:22"/> the former Quotation were taken from the Analepſis of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and it was that Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Book that <hi>S. James</hi> quoted and called it <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This can be no ſtrange thing to him that conſiders what was intimated before, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had probably theſe Books join'd to their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> and therefore they might well be called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> without any addition. The Apocryphal Books that are in our Bibles were commonly call'd ſo by the Primitive Fathers. Thus <hi>Clement</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, <hi>Strom.</hi> v. <hi>p.</hi> 431.

Hom.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 155. <hi>D.</hi>] There are many the like Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be found in the writings of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt Fathers. They familiarly called ſuch Books, <hi>The Scriptures,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>The Holy Scriptures;</hi> and yet they never attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the ſame Authority to them, as to the Books that were received into the Canon of the Old Teſtament, which, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>were written by Divine Inſpiration,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the Prophecy of <hi>Enoch,</hi> out of which St. <hi>Jude</hi> brings a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in his Epiſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Annotations on the place, ſaith, This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was extant in the Apoſtles times, in a Book that went under the name of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Enoch;</hi> and was a Book of great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93550:22"/> credit among the <hi>Jews;</hi> for it is cited in their <hi>Zohar,</hi> and was not unknown to <hi>Celſus</hi> the Heathen Philoſopher, for he alſo cited is, as appears by <hi>Origen</hi>'s Anſwer to him; [<hi>Orig.</hi> in <hi>Celſ. lib. V.] Grotius</hi> alſo ſhews, that this Book is often cited by the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and he takes notice of a large piece of it that is preſerved by <hi>Georg. Syncellus</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon.</hi> And whereas in this piece there are many fabulous things, he very well judges that they might be foiſted in, as many ſuch things have been thruſt into very Ancient Books. But whether his Conjecture in this be true or no, it is certain that the piece which is quoted by St. <hi>Jude</hi> was truly the Prophecy of <hi>Enoch,</hi> becauſe we have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Authority to aſſure us of the Hiſtorical truth of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is clear that the <hi>Jews</hi> had very good and authentic Traditions, concerning the Authors, the Uſe, and the Sence of divers parts of the Old Teſtament. For Example, St. <hi>Mat. Chap.</hi> xxvii. 9. quotes <hi>Jeremy</hi> for the Author of a paſſage, which he there tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, and which we find in <hi>Zechary</hi> xi. 12. How could this be? but that it was a thing known among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the four laſt Chapters of the Book of <hi>Zechary</hi> were written by <hi>Jeremy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Medes</hi> Works. p. 709. and 963. and 1022.</note> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has proved by many Arguments. It is by the help of this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Ancient Interpreters have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Pſalms ſuch Titles as expreſs their deſign, and their uſage in the Synagogue. Certainly theſe Titles which ſhew the deſign of many of the Pſalms, contribute much to make us underſtand the ſenſe of thoſe Pſalms;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93550:23"/> which a man that knows the occaſion of their Compoſing, will apprehend more perfectly than he can do that reads the Pſalms without theſe Aſſiſtances. And for the Titles of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pſalms in the Septuagint, and other of the Ancient Tranſlations, which ſhew on what days they were ſung in the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Jews;</hi> as <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxiv. 48, 81, 82, 93, 94, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' theſe Titles are not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and therefore are not part of the <hi>Jews</hi> Scripture; yet that they had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this by Tradition, we find by <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> who tho' a ſtranger to thoſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations,<note place="margin">De cultu divino tract. de ſacrificiis jugibus. <hi>c. 6. Sect. 9.</hi>
                  </note> yet affirms that thoſe ſeveral Pſalms were ſung on ſuch and ſuch days; and he names the very days that are prefixt to them in the ſaid Titles.</p>
               <p>It is from the ſame Tradition, that they have theſe Rules concerning the Pſalms: I. This Rule to know the Authors of them; namely, that all Pſalms, that are not inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with ſome other name, are <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, although they bear not his name; a Maxim, owned by <hi>Aben-Ezra,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Praefat. in Pſalmos</note> and <hi>David Kimchi;</hi> and we ſee an Inſtance of this Rule in that Quotation of <hi>Pſ.</hi> xcv. 7. which is aſcribed to <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 7. II. From hence they have learnt alſo another Rule, by which they diſtinguiſh between the Pſalms ſpoken by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his own name,<note place="margin">Tehillim. Rabbat. in Pſ. 24. Fol. 22. col. 2.</note> and as King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and thoſe which he ſpoke in the name of the Synagogue, without any particular reſpect to his own time, but in a proſpect of the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt future times.<note place="margin">Tehillim. Rab. Ib.</note> From thence they have learned to diſtinguiſh between the Pſalms in which the Holy Ghoſt ſpoke of the preſent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93550:23"/> times, and thoſe in which he ſpeaks of the times to come, <hi>viz.</hi> of the time of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> So <hi>R. David Kimchi,</hi> and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that the Pſalms 93, 94. till the Pſalm 101. ſpeak of the days of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> So they remark upon <hi>Pſ.</hi> 92. whoſe Title is for the Sabbath-day, that it is for the time to come, which ſhall be all Sabbath. <hi>Manaſſeh. Ben. Iſ. in Exod. q.</hi> 102.</p>
               <p>By the help of Tradition alſo, they clear the Text, <hi>Ex.</hi> xii. 40. where it is ſaid, <hi>That the ſojourning of the Children of Iſrael, who dwelt in Aegypt, was</hi> 430 <hi>years.</hi> It would be a great miſtake of theſe words, to think the meaning of them ſhould be, that the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> dwelled in <hi>Aegypt</hi> 430 years: For in truth they dwelled there but half the time, as the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves reckon, and all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men do agree to it. But the <hi>Jews</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by theſe words, that the ſojourning of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all the while they dwelled in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they and their Fathers, was 430 years. Thus all the <hi>Rabbins</hi> do underſtand it, and thus it was anciently explained, by putting in words to this ſenſe, in the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Text, and in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> LXX. That they were in the right, we ſee by the Apoſtle's reckoning the time to have been 430 years, from the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> at his coming into <hi>Canaan,</hi> till the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which was but 50 days after their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner from Tradition they filled up that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> IV. 8. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Cain</hi> talkt with <hi>Abel</hi> his Brother, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93550:24"/> the words which he ſpoke, <hi>Let us go into the field.</hi> This Inſertion is not only in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> LXX. but the <hi>Samaritans</hi> have it in their Bibles, and they had it there in S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s time. It is alſo extant in the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem Targum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. q<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. det p. 120, 124, 125.</note> 
                  <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> Philoſophiſes on theſe words much after the ſame manner as doth the <hi>Targum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is certain that they have had very common among them the knowledge of the moſt illuſtrious Prophecies of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> This we may ſee in the Anſwer of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> Woman to our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 25. where ſhe ſaith, <hi>I know that when the Meſſias is come, he will tell us all things.</hi> For though it is no where plainly ſaid, yet the <hi>Samaritans</hi> knew full well, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould explain all things, according to the Traditional ſenſe of that Prophecy in <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 15, 18, 19. which hath been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly referr'd to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that we find till this day in the <hi>Midraſh</hi> upon <hi>Eccleſiaſt. c.</hi> 1.9. that the laſt Redeemer ſhall be like the firſt, that is, <hi>Moſes.</hi> And in conſequence of this knowledge commonly received among the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. xii. 34.</note> did they of Chriſt's time hold for certain, <hi>that the Meſſiah ſhould remain for ever;</hi> which their Poſterity not knowing how to reconcile with their Notion of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they fancied that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould dye after a long Reign, and leave his Crown to his Children from Generation to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> anſwered <hi>Herod</hi> without delay, <hi>Mat.</hi> ii. 5, 6. that the <hi>Meſſiah ſhould be born at Bethlehem,</hi> according
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93550:24"/> to <hi>Micah</hi>'s Prophecy, though it is not plainly ſaid in the Text of that Prophecy, <hi>Micah</hi> v. 2. Hence alſo it was that <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Mat. iii. 5, 6. found the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to repentance, that they might eſcape God's Judgments threatned on the Nation at the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> according to <hi>Joel</hi>'s prediction recited <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 26. and that other Prophecy in <hi>Malach.</hi> iv. 5.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that when <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſent his Diſciples to our Saviour to ask him, <hi>Whether he were the Meſſias or no;</hi> our Saviour gave them this Anſwer, <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 4. <hi>Go and tell John the things which you hear and ſee; The Blind receive their ſight, the Lame walk, the Lepers are cleanſed, the Deaf hear, the Dead are raiſed, and the poor have the Goſpel preached to them.</hi> This is commonly taken to be a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> xxxv. 1. There ſome indeed of theſe Characters do point out the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> But our Saviour did not content himſelf with thoſe, but added others that are not in that Text, nor in any other, but ſuch as no doubt the <hi>Jews</hi> had at that time in their common Tradition.</p>
               <p>This Remark is of great moment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the boldneſs of ſome Criticks, as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who ſuppoſe that ſome places in the Apocryphal Books, which ſhew that they were exactly acquainted with the Ideas of the Prophets upon the Divinity and the Glory of the Meſſias, ſuch as we ſee in the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiasticus,</hi> and in <hi>Baruch,</hi> have been foiſted in by Chriſtians in thoſe Books, when to the contrary they were to judge that the <hi>Jews</hi> have laid aſide theſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93550:25"/> Books for that very reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they were a ſtrong proof that the Apoſtles did apply the Prophecies of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the ſenſe of the Synagogue before Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It was from hence that our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. ſhew'd the multitude, that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger promiſed by God in <hi>Malach.</hi> iii. 1. as he that ſhould be the fore-runner of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> and that ſhould prepare his way by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the People to Repentance: and he proves that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was ſo, by the great Effect of his Preaching, in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe that ſeemed the moſt corrupt of the Nation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is as certain, that they had by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſundry Explications of the Scripture grounded upon Allegories. <hi>Philo</hi> affirms this poſitively [<hi>lib. de Therapeutis, p.</hi> 691.] St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us ſeveral Examples of it. We have one in <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 9. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus argues from the Words of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> xcv. 11. <hi>There remains therefore a Reſt for the people of God.</hi> His Argument depends upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſix days of the Creation, as foreſhewing that the Age of the World ſhould be 6000 years; and underſtands the Sabbath, or Reſt, of the times after; founding their Expoſition on the Words of the 90th <hi>Pſalm, A thouſand years in thy ſight are as but one day:</hi> That is to be ſeen in <hi>R. Abraham bar Hiya Hannaſhi Megillat ha Megillat Saar.</hi> 2. in <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> upon <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 2. in <hi>Abarbanel Miphaloth Eloh. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:93550:25"/>
               <p>Another Example we have in the ſame St. <hi>Paul, Galat.</hi> iv. 24. drawn from <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> as being Types of the two Covenants. <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew [de Cherub. p.</hi> 83.] found a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery there before St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as we ſee in a Book of his that was much more ancient than that Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>A third Example may be found in the ſame St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who uſes it <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 14. &amp; 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> xv. 47. in comparing the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whom he calls <hi>the ſecond Adam.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> have the ſame Idea of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as of the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> who ſhall raiſe all his Followers from the Sepulchre, as we ſee in <hi>Pirke Eliezer,</hi> ch. 32.</p>
               <p>This method of explaining Scripture ought to be carefully conſidered, becauſe it gives us to underſtand the Reaſons why the <hi>Jews</hi> have regarded the <hi>Song of Songs</hi> as a part of Canonical Scripture, and have referred it to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as we ſee they do in their <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> in <hi>Cant.</hi> i. 8. iv. 5. vii. 14. viii. 1, 4. The ſame reflection may be made on their acknowledging of the Divine Authority of the Book of <hi>Ruth,</hi> wherein their <hi>Targum</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> chap. iii. 15. And the like may be ſaid of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> certain Texts of which, as <hi>ch.</hi> i. 18. and <hi>ch.</hi> viii. 25. they refer to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which otherwiſe ſeem not to have much relation to him.</p>
               <p>In truth, one cannot well deny that the <hi>Jews</hi> had this common knowledge of great Truths of their Religion, and a Traditional Expoſition of great Prophecies, from their Anceſtors, to clear their Ideas thereof, if he conſiders attentively theſe following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>

Which is an argument, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of the Prophets had made great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on their Minds, and raiſed a great Concern in them for their Religion, and for the ſtudy of the Scripture, which contained the Precepts of it. But it was impoſſible that in reading the Writings of the Prophets, and hearing them explained by their Doctors, they ſhould give no attention to the great Promiſes of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whoſe Coming was ſpoken of by ſome of the Prophets, as being very near at hand. See <hi>Dan.</hi> ix. <hi>Hag.</hi> ii. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach.</hi> iii.</p>
               <p>The Second is, That their Zeal for the Scriptures, and their Religion, was really much quickned by the cruel Perſecution which they ſuffered from <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes;</hi> whoſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Fury did particularly extend to the Holy Scriptures, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> i. 56, 57. and to whatever elſe did contribute to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their Religion.</p>
               <p>The Third is, That it appears from Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that there were more Writers of their Nation ſince the Captivity, than we read of at any time before: ſo ſaith <hi>Joſephus, lib. I. contr. Appion.</hi> Eſpecially ſince they came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of the <hi>Ptolomeys</hi> and the <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae,</hi> who being Princes of a <hi>Greek</hi> Original,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93550:26"/> were great Lovers of Learning, and did much for the improving of good Letters.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is, That learned Men among the <hi>Jews,</hi> applying themſelves to this buſineſs, did write, either at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at <hi>Babylon,</hi> or at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſeveral Extracts of ancient Books of Morality for the inſtruction of their People. Such were the Books of <hi>Baruch</hi> and <hi>Eſdras,</hi> which ſeem to have been written in <hi>Chaldee;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> which were written in <hi>Greek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fifth is, That the great Buſineſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Synagogues, and in their Schools, hath been ever ſince to underſtand the Books of the Prophets, and to explain them in a Language intelligible to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> being in great part loſt during the time of the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Captivity.</p>
               <p>The Sixth is, That it does indeed appear, that this was the proper time in which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paraphraſes began firſt to be formed. They were began and carried on inſenſibly; One adding ſome <hi>Chaldee</hi> Words in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of his Book, oppoſite to the Text, which the People did not underſtand ſo well: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adding to theſe ſome Notes in another place; till at length <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Onkelos,</hi> or ſome other Doctor of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all theſe Obſervations, and made thence thoſe Paraphraſes which we have under their Name.</p>
               <p>For the Confirmation of this Conjecture, conſider, 1. That we find in theſe Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes very many Explications, which by no means agree with the Ideas that the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:93550:27"/> have framed to themſelves ſince the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity. For ſince their Diſputes with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they found themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in many particulars to reject the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and refute the Confeſſions of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. 2. We ſee the very ſame thing has happened among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that ſet themſelves to write <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> or Notes on the Scriptures: which are only Abſtracts of Authors who have written or preacht more at large on theſe Books. The ſame thing, I ſay, hapned among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> in the VIIIth Century, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, when moſt of their Learning was reduced within this compaſs, To compile Gloſſes, and to collect the Opinion of thoſe that went before them, upon difficult places; and after that, to form out of all theſe Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes one continued Paraphraſe upon the whole Book, as if it had been the Judgment and Work of one and the ſame Author. It's the Character of all the Books which they call <hi>Catenae</hi> upon Scripture.</p>
               <p>I know well, that ſome Criticks call in queſtion the Antiquity of theſe Paraphraſes; and have remarked how ridiculous the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay were wrought in favour of <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Uzziel.</hi> But what does this make for their doubting the Antiquity of theſe pieces? Do we que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether there was a <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Old Teſtament before Chriſt's time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can hardly believe <hi>Ariſtaeas</hi>'s Hiſtory to be true, or becauſe we cannot ſay that the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion is deliver'd down to us in the ſame purity as it was at firſt written? Ought
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93550:27"/> we to ſuſpect St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Homilies on St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, or thoſe of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt; becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ſtoried that St. <hi>Paul</hi> came to inſpire St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> with the Senſe of his Epiſtles, while he was medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Expoſition of them; and becauſe the <hi>Latins</hi> do relate the like Fable in favour of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt?</p>
               <p>After all, the Authority of theſe Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes does ſtill further appear, in that the Works themſelves are ſpread almoſt as far as there are <hi>Jews</hi> in the World, and are highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd in all places of their Diſperſion.</p>
               <p>Some may perhaps imagin, that the <hi>Jews</hi> being fallen into great Corruptions about the time of our Bleſſed Saviour's coming into the World, muſt neceſſarily at that time have loſt much of that Light, which their Anceſtors received of the Prophets, and of thoſe that ſucceeded the Prophets. They may think, it may be, that their Nation being become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> did by inſenſible degrees change their Principles, and alter their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Scripture, as they adopted the Ideas of the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers, whoſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they then began to borrow. In ſhort, it may be conceived by ſome, that the ſeveral Sects, which aroſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt's time, did conſiderably alter the Opinions of the Synagogue, and did corrupt their Tradition, and the Notions they had received from the moſt ancient Doctors of their Schools.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to all this. It is certain the Corruption among the <hi>Jews</hi> was principally of their Morals; for which, though they had
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93550:28"/> very good Precepts in their Law; yet the true meaning of them was ſpoiled and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Gloſſes, which were deviſed, as I have ſhewn, in later times; and with theſe, being ſtampt with the Name of <hi>Tradition,</hi> they evaded the force of the Laws. There were then but very few that had not an averſion to the <hi>Greek</hi> Learning, and thoſe few applied themſelves to it, while they were in <hi>Judaea,</hi> with great Caution and Secrecy, leſt they ſhould be lookt upon as <hi>Heathens. Joſephus</hi> witneſſeth of that, <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 20. <hi>c. ult.</hi> As to what is inferred from the many Sects among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the quite contrary is clear. For the oppoſition of one Sect to the other, hindred any one of them from becoming Maſters of the People and their Faith in ſo general a manner, as to be able to corrupt abſolutely their Traditional Notions of Religion.</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe Sects, all but the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who were abhorred by the People, knew no other way to diſtinguiſh themſelves and draw eſteem, but by a ſtrict Obſervation of the Law and its Ceremonies, to which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Rules they gave their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did very much contribute; whence they called their Traditions the Hedge and the Rampart of the Law.</p>
               <p>To conclude, We ought carefully to take notice, 1. That St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did not find it needful to correct the Errors in Opinions that reigned among the People; but only exhorted them to Repentance for their Sins and immoral Actions. 2. That one of the chief Concerns of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Diſcourſes with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was to purge
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93550:28"/> them of all that Corruption which their drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Caſuiſts had introduced into their Morals; with which he charges the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> in particular. 3. That the Doctrine of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> which he refutes on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, had but a few Followers. 4. That the <hi>Eſſens</hi> and their Party, who applied themſelves altogether to Piety, and the Study of the Law, had a great Authority with all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that loved Religion. This we may learn from <hi>Philo</hi> in ſome Pieces of his Works, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Lib. quod omnis Probus ſit liber,</hi> p. 678. 5. That the <hi>Jews,</hi> though they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very groſs Ideas concerning a Temporal Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and though to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port theſe Ideas, they have confounded the Senſe of divers Prophecies, endeavouring to reconcile them to their carnal Notions, and in bringing in new Explications of the Old Teſtament; yet have they not been able quite to extinguiſh their ancienter Ideas and Principles: Their new Ideas paſſing for no more at beſt than the Opinions of their cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Doctors, which another Doctor may oppoſe if he will, eſpecially, when he is backt with thoſe that are ancienter and of greater Authority.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub"> That the <hi>Jews</hi> had certain Traditional Maxims and Rules for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Scripture.</head>
               <p>WHat I have now ſaid concerning the Traditions of the Synagogue, will, I believe, be ſcarcely diſputed by any Learned Man; I am ſure he will have leſs reaſon to oppoſe it, that conſiders the Rules, which, as appears to us, were followed by the <hi>Jews</hi> in explaining the Prophecies concerning their Promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is certain that the <hi>Jews</hi> held this as a Maxim, That all the Prophets did ſpeak of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and were raiſed up by God for this very end. This we find more than once in their <hi>Talmud;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beracoth. c. 1. fol. 3. Sanhed. c. 11.</note> and that it was common among them in Chriſt's time, we ſee in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of the Goſpel. No doubt what they did in ſetling this Rule, was not without a due and ſerious Examination of it firſt. And here we cannot but deplore the raſhneſs of ſome Criticks among Chriſtians, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making uſe of the Confeſſions of the Old <hi>Jews</hi> upon places of the Old Teſtament, which they referr'd conſtantly to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> whereas ſome of the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour to wreſt them in another ſenſe, not only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the new ones, but give occaſion by theſe means to deſpiſe Prophecies, and the clearer ones, as things quite inſignificant. What was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93550:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Abſurdity of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who in the 53d of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> by the Servant which is ſpoken of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, underſtands <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet; whereas the Old <hi>Jews</hi> refer that Chapter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as you can ſee in the Old <hi>Midraſh Chonen,</hi> in the <hi>Targum,</hi> in the <hi>Talmud Sanhed. fol.</hi> 98. <hi>c.</hi> 2. and that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by <hi>R. Alſhek. in h. l.</hi> to be the ſenſe of the ancient <hi>Jews.</hi> And indeed they hold as a Maxim, That whenſoever it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken abſolutely of the Servant, the place muſt be underſtood of the Meſſias, <hi>Zohar</hi> in <hi>Exod. fol.</hi> 225. and by conſequence they explained that Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> as concerning the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi> I can ſay the ſame upon another Maxim of the Old <hi>Jews,</hi> which is of great Uſe, That whatſoever it is ſpoken of the King abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the place muſt be underſtood of the Meſſias, <hi>Zohar</hi> in <hi>Gen. fol.</hi> 235. If <hi>Grotius</hi> had known it, he never would have related the 72d <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and ſome others, to <hi>Salomon</hi> in his literal ſenſe as he hath done, but would have referred it, as it muſt be directly to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Certainly that ſhews us, that many of the Old <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood the Prophets much better than, to their ſhame, ſuch Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks now do. I wonder many times Divines, who confeſs they cannot give any tolerable account of the <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> and look upon it as a Piece compoſed by <hi>Salomon</hi> upon the occaſion of his Marriage with the Daughter of <hi>Egypt;</hi> whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> look upon it conſtantly as the laſt Piece he compoſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Repentance; and we have reaſon enough to believe, when we compare it with the 45th <hi>Pſalm</hi> and the 5th of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:93550:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpoke then of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Eſſential Word ſpoken of by him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. chiefly when we ſee the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> do agree to it. See <hi>Philo de Colon. apud Grot.</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 22. <hi>Breſch. Rabba par.</hi> 1. the firſt Words, and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſh in ſhir haſh. in Merceſſu.</hi> But let us come back to our Subject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay 2dly, That it is reaſonable to judge, that the later Prophets having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably cleared the Prophecies of thoſe that went before them, by diffuſing throughout their Writings a much greater Light; they who read the later Prophets, were not ſo careleſs as to neglect theſe Helps for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the more ancient Prophecies, whoſe ſenſe was otherwiſe not a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. In theſe Caſes it was neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Prophets that writ laſt, and by their Light to clear the ancient Prophecies. According to this Method, the Paraphraſes aſcribe to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> what we read of the Seed of the Woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. and what <hi>Balaam</hi> prophecied, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxiii. and xxiv. And no one can doubt, but that after that great Light that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gave them concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and his Unction, in his Prophecy <hi>Chap.</hi> xi. they referred to him thoſe words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> xviii. 18. <hi>God ſhall raiſe thee up a Prophet like unto me,</hi> which is cited by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as ſpoken of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> following herein the Principles of the Synagogue, <hi>Act.</hi> iii. 22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not to be doubted but that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience was a great help towards their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Prophecies. If it had not been for this, the <hi>Jews</hi> would have lookt no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93550:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> than to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for the fulfilling of that Prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> xviii. 18. <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the Earth be bleſſed;</hi> and likewiſe to <hi>Salomon,</hi> for that which we read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vii. 16. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxvi. But ſeeing the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were not accompliſhed in their Perſons, nor did anſwer to their Characters; and it is impoſſible that the Prophecies ſhould be falſe; the <hi>Jews</hi> were convinced, as they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they ought to refer theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> as alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the way of his Nation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is clear there were certain general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which whereſoever they were found, were commonly thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note that that place ſhould be underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And it is worth obſerving, that the Light ſtill encreaſing from one Age to the other, and the Characters of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> being every day more unfolded and opened, 'twas eaſy for them that ſtudied the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to compare one with the other, and from thence to draw Rules to find out the Ideas of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in thoſe Promiſes which ſeemed not ſo diſtinctly and evidently to ſpeak of him.</p>
               <p>To give ſome Examples of the Rules which they gathered for their direction in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prophecies that relate to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> I ſay, that the moſt conſpicuous Character of him, and that which they moſt ſet their hearts upon, was this, That he ſhould come in the later Times to deliver his People from their Enemies, and to reign over the whole Earth in great Peace, and Proſperity, and Glory. This in Groſs will be acknowledged
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93550:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> by all the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Age. But to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Matters yet more particularly. It is worthy to be obſerved, that by comparing theſe Texts which ſpeak of the low Eſtate and Sufferings of one that is there alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as being in the higheſt Glory and Dignity; they have been convinced, that both theſe Deſcriptions are of one and the ſame Perſon; and therefore notwithſtanding the Prophetical Deſcriptions of the Glory of their Promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> at his coming, they have acknowledged thoſe Prophecies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him alſo, which ſpeak of his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as that in <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. 9. where he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Riding upon an Aſs: ſo you ſee in the <hi>Targum</hi> and in the <hi>Talmud;</hi> and that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> liii. where he is ſaid to be loaded with Griefs, and to be the moſt deſpiſed of Men; as you ſee in the <hi>Targum,</hi> in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and in <hi>Midraſh Conen.</hi> To which may be added that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> xxii. and that of <hi>Zech.</hi> xii. 10. which treat of the ſame Matter, and were referred to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, wherever Salvation is ſpoke of, they refer thoſe Prophecies to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as him who ſhould be the Author of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is by this rule that <hi>Iſa.</hi> lii. and liii. and <hi>Hab.</hi> iii. are underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus thoſe places wherein the Subjection and Converſion of the Nations are foretold, were by them judged, without any heſitation, to regard the Times of the <hi>Meſſias. Scadias Haggaon</hi> interprets <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. 9. of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>his univerſal dominion is ſpoken of.</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93550:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> And ſo <hi>R. David Kimchi</hi> refers to the Meſſias time the place of <hi>Zech.</hi> ii. 10, 11. Upon this known foundation does St. <hi>Paul</hi> build his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Meſſias, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 10. out of <hi>Pſ.</hi> cii. 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 11. out of <hi>Pſ.</hi> cxvii. 1. And, to be ſhort, all thoſe Pſalms which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent God as reigning over the whole Earth, do relate to the Meſſias, according to the ſenſe of the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> as may be ſeen in the many places of their Paraphraſes, and of their Interpreters; as <hi>Raſhi Kimchi</hi> and <hi>R. Joel Aben Soeb</hi> upon the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 99. and 100.</p>
               <p>Thus again, when the Scripture foretells the calling of the Gentiles to the knowledge of the true God, they fail not to underſtand thoſe predictions of the times of the Meſſias, who ſhould ſpread true Religion throughout the World. Hence it is that <hi>Iſa.</hi> ii. is ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them.<note place="margin">Lib de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fug. p. <hi>364.</hi> &amp; lib. de Somn. p. <hi>872. and</hi> R.

               </p>
               <p>In this manner did they reflect on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies that ſpake of the Meſſias's Prieſthood, after that <hi>David</hi> had enlightned them in <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. as may be ſeen from the Notions of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> touching the Prieſthood of the Word, by an alluſion to the Hiſtory of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe did they own that the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God to reeſtabliſh the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> were to be accompliſhed by the Meſſias, and by this rule they affirm'd that the Song of <hi>Anna</hi> did concern the time of the Meſſias, for the words of that Song do not agree nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Saul,</hi> nor to <hi>David,</hi> but to the time of the Meſſias. As alſo they underſtood in like manner the Prophecy of <hi>Amos</hi> ix. 11, 15, 16, 17.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93550:32"/> according to the ſenſe of the Synagogue and the Prophecy of <hi>Zechary</hi> vi. 12, <hi>&amp;c. Rabboth. fol.</hi> 271. <hi>col.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>They acknowledged according to theſe rules of Interpretation, that where Aſcenſion into Heaven, and ſitting on God's right hand, was ſpoken of, they were ſpoken of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias; and thus they referred to him <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxviii. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> xcvii. and what is ſaid <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. being all ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Texts inſiſted by the Writers of the New Teſtament, as paſſages which in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Jews</hi> did concern the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>We ought eſpecially to obſerve that they never failed to make thoſe reflections upon thoſe particular Pſalms, whereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, as they underſtood them, ſpoke in the name of the Synagogue, with reſpect to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times, and who mention there a Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that ſhould partake of the deliverance there promiſed. And from this allowed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim alſo, does St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> i. refer <hi>Pſal.</hi> cii. to the Meſſias. For this Character is found expreſly in <hi>v.</hi> 22. of this Pſalm; as well as the calling of the Gentiles, and the Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Kings to God is foretold, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>We muſt take notice of another thing, which is a conſequence of what they obſerved in ſome eminent Propheſies, <hi>viz.</hi> they underſtood them very rationally, by the help of thoſe Ideas which they met with in other Propheſies which otherwiſe ſeem not ſo clearly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſame Meſſias which is ſpoken of in clearer Propheſies. 'Twas according to that rule that they referred the Hymn of <hi>Anna,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 5. to the times of the Meſſias,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93550:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>Kimchi</hi> in <hi>h. l.</hi> compareth it with the words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ch. liv. <hi>Rejoice thou barren that beareſt not, &amp;c.</hi> 'Twas according to that method that they being convinced that the <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxii. was to be referred to the Meſſias, did refer alſo to him the <hi>Pſal.</hi> xli. as it is referred by St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> x. the ſame Ideas of ſuffering being found in both Pſalms. <hi>R. Menach. de Rekam fol.</hi> 19. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>in Pentat.</hi> It was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame method that they referred to the <hi>Sekinah</hi> or Meſſias all the Pſalms which have the Title, all <hi>Shoſannin,</hi> viz. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.69.80. as we ſee in the ſame <hi>R. Menachem fol.</hi> 106. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>in Pent.</hi> The <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> as I have obſerved, was the Key which made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſubject of thoſe Pſalms, as the Song of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ch. 5. made them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Song of Songs.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that the greater part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation being oppreſſed with the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoak, and finding no comfort for it in theſe Notions, which are for the moſt part Spiritual, did therefore about our Saviour's time frame to themſelves more carnal notions concerning the Kingdom of the Meſſias: Fancying that he ſhould come as a victorious Prince, to conquer, and to avenge them of their Enemies. They removed from their thoughts the accounts of his Death, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe Glorious deſcriptions which ſuited better with their minds. They expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Meſſias ſhould come to reſtore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Kingdom unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and, in a word, following their own Deſires and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, they confounded Chriſt's firſt coming with his ſecond; and then confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93550:33"/> themſelves in this miſtake, partly, becauſe the Prophets ſeemed to deſcribe the Kingdom of the Meſſias very carnally, partly, becauſe they knew not what to think of a Coeleſtial or Spiritual Kingdom, ſuch as his ſhould be, who was to ſit on the Throne of God. And theſe falſe conceits of theirs, joined with the worldly Intereſts of their Leaders, brought them to reject the true Meſſias at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>But after all, it is certain, 1. That the contrary opinions, concerning the Spiritual ſenſe of the Prophecies, was the conſtant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctrine of their Nation. 2. That thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that were converted to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the Miniſtry of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, were converted upon theſe Maxims, which were then the Maxims of the wiſeſt and the Religiouſeſt part of their Nation. 3. That the Apoſtles in their Writings, as well as Chriſt Jeſus in his Diſcourſes, cited the Texts of the Old Teſtament according to the commonly received ſenſe of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; And in truth the authority of theſe proofs in that received ſenſe did not a little contribute to the Converſion of both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to make the Reader of my mind, I intreat him to take in good part my entring a little further into the examination, of what the moſt ſtudious <hi>Jews</hi> in the Holy Scriptures do commonly propoſe under the name of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Let them be lookt upon by ſome Men as dreaming Authors, that buſie themſelves in Enquiries altogether vain and fruitleſs; yet it is no hard task to vindicate them from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93550:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> this hard Imputation. 1. I have this to ſay for them, That that which appears ſo phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, (becauſe not underſtood by moſt of thoſe which have been accuſtomed to the <hi>Greek</hi> Methods of Teaching,) ought not therefore to be deſpiſed and wholly rejected. None but Fools will think this a ſufficient reaſon why all <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Doctrines ought to be contemned; becauſe that he having been a Scholar of <hi>Pherecydes</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> and other learned Men in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> did borrow thence his way of teaching Theology by Symbols, which is attainable only by few, and thoſe of no common Capacity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I obſerve that moſt of the true <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors that followed the Tradition of their Schools, had this deſign principally in their eye, to make Men fully underſtand the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of God's Conduct for the Reſtoration of fallen Mankind. To this in particular they bend their Thoughts, and in this they endeavour'd to inſtruct their Readers, explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, according to this ſenſe, ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, which at firſt ſight ſeem not immediately to regard ſo important a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I obſerve that oftentimes, where they attribute theſe Interpretations of Scripture to a Tradition delivered down to them from their Fathers, it is only in order to render their Reflections on the Scriptures ſo much the more venerable to their Hearers. For it is plain enough in ſome places, that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Meditation on the Words might have diſcover'd the ſame things which they refer to Tradition.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:93550:34"/>
               <p>For Example. They remark that God ſaid concerning <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Reuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin Cabalae, l. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>628.</hi>
                  </note> Gen. iii. 22. <hi>And now leſt he ſtretch out his hand, and eat of the tree of life, and live for ever; therefore God, as it follows, drove him out Paradiſe.</hi> From hence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that God gave <hi>Adam</hi> hopes of becoming one day immortal, by eating of the Tree of Life, which they thought ſhould be obtained for him by the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Now it appears that our Bleſſed Saviour did allude to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was then eſteemed as a Tradition, <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree that is in the Paradiſe of God.</hi> And this Notion is repeated, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 2, 14.</p>
               <p>Again they remark that God ſaid, <hi>Behold, Adam is become like one of us,</hi> Gen. iii. 22. And they maintain that he ſpeaks not this to the Angels, who had no common likeneſs to the Unity or Eſſence of God, but to him who was the Celeſtial <hi>Adam,</hi> who is one with God. As <hi>Jonathan</hi> has alſo obſerved in his <hi>Targum</hi> on theſe words of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> calling him the <hi>only-begotten in Heaven.</hi> Now it is plain that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has deſcribed Jeſus Chriſt as this Heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv.</p>
               <p>They aſſert that the firſt Prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. was underſtood by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> of the Saviour of the World; and that <hi>Eve,</hi> in proſpect of this, being delivered of her firſt Son,<note place="margin">Gen. iv. 1. <hi>Reuchl. Ibid. p.</hi> 629.</note> ſhe called him <hi>Cain,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have got a man, or this man from the Lord;</hi> believing that he was the Promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi> They tell us farther, that <hi>Eve</hi> being deceived in this expectation, as alſo in her hopes from <hi>Abel,</hi> asked another Son of God, who gave her
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93550:34"/> 
                  <hi>Seth;</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>Adam begot ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son after his own Image,</hi> another with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> that was killed, not to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity by <hi>Cain,</hi> for they bear the Image of the Devil, rather than that of God. They maintain the Name of <hi>Enos</hi> to have been given <hi>Seth</hi>'s Son upon the ſame account,<note place="margin">Reuchl Ibid. p. <hi>630,</hi> &amp; <hi>631.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe they thought him <hi>that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man</hi> whom God had promiſed. They make the like Remarks on <hi>Enoch, Noa,</hi> and <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi>'s Bleſſing of <hi>Sem</hi> they look'd on as an Earneſt Wiſh, that God in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would give them the Redeemer of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>They affirm that <hi>Abraham</hi> had not been ſo ready to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> a Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Reuchl Ibid. p. <hi>632.</hi>
                  </note> but that he hoped God would ſave the World from Sin by that Means; and that <hi>Iſaac</hi> had not ſuffered himſelf to be bound, had he not been of the ſame belief. And they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that it was ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> on purpoſe to ſhew them the miſtake of this Opinion, <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> A plain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the <hi>Jews</hi> anciently thought that theſe words did relate to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as did alſo St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> iii. 16.</p>
               <p>They maintain,<note place="margin">Reuchl. Ib. p. <hi>633.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>Jacob</hi> believed that God would fulfil to him the firſt Promiſe made to <hi>Adam,</hi> till God undeceived him by inſpiring him with a Prophecy concerning <hi>Judah, Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. and by ſignifying to him; which alſo <hi>Jacob</hi> tells his Sons, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould not come but in the laſt days, <hi>v.</hi> 1. when the <hi>Scepter</hi> was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>the Law-giver</hi> from between his Feet, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reuchl. Ib. p. <hi>633.</hi>
                  </note>They declare that ever ſince this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, the Coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> for the Redemption of Mankind has been the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of all the Prophets to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the Object of <hi>David</hi>'s and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet's Longings and Deſires.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reuchl. Ib. p. <hi>634.</hi>
                  </note>They maintain that <hi>David</hi> did not think himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe he prays for his Coming, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xliii. 3. <hi>Send out thy Light, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as <hi>R.

               <p>They did think <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpake of him, <hi>ch.</hi> ix. 6. So <hi>R. Joſe Galilaeus praefat. in Eccha Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bati,</hi> as it is to be ſeen in <hi>Devarim Rabba Paras.</hi>

And indeed what he there ſaith could not be meant of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who was born 10 years before; nor was his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo extenſive, nor ſo laſting, as is there foretold the <hi>Meſſias</hi>'s ſhould be, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a ſmall part of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and ended in <hi>Sedecias</hi> his Succeſſor not many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons afterwards.</p>
               <p>And it is the general and conſtant Opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>Malachi,</hi> the laſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſpake of him, <hi>ch.</hi> 4. under the Name of the <hi>Son of Righteouſneſs:</hi> for this ſee <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It ought to be well conſidered, that we owe the Knowledge of the Principles on which the Holy Ghoſt has founded the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Types, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are ſo devoted to the Traditions of their Anceſtors; which Types, however they who read the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93550:35"/> Scripture curſorily, do ordinarily paſs by, as things light and inſignificant; yet it is true what St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 11. That all things happened to the Fathers in Types, and were written for their inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the World are come, or who live in the laſt Times, as the Oeconomy of the Goſpel is called, and <hi>the laſt days</hi> by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> xlix. 1. That is, acknowledged by the Wiſemen of the Nation in <hi>Shemoth Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Paraſha</hi> 1, and by <hi>Menaſſeh ben Iſrael q.</hi> 6. in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> p. 23.</p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>Jews,</hi> beſides the literal ſenſe of the ancient Scriptures, did acknowledge a myſtical or ſpiritual Senſe, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays down for a Maxim, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where he applies to things of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all theſe following Types; namely the Coming of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their paſſage through the Red Sea, the Hiſtory of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and of the Rock that followed them by its Water.</p>
               <p>We ſee in <hi>Philo</hi> the figurative ſenſe which the <hi>Jews</hi> gave to a great part of the ancient Hiſtory: He remarks exactly, (and often with too much ſubtilty, perhaps,) the many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Moral Notions which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prophetical Figures do ſuggeſt to us.</p>
               <p>We ſee that they turned almoſt all their Hiſtory into Allegory. It plainly appears from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of arguing, <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which could be of no force otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee that they reduced to an Anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical ſenſe all the Temporal Promiſes, of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of the Temple; in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93550:36"/> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo followed them, <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 4, 9. quoting theſe words. <hi>If they ſhall enter into my reſt,</hi> from <hi>Pſ.</hi> xcv. 11. which words he makes the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeak of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above; and this alſo is acknowledged by <hi>Maimonides de poen. c.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>This Remark ought to be made particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the myſtical Signification which <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> gives of ſeveral Parts of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; of which the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes ſo great uſe in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> in thoſe few words which he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Signification of the Tabernacle, <hi>Antiq.</hi> iii. 9. gives us reaſon enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if he had lived to finiſh his deſign of explaining the Law according to the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Midraſhim,</hi> he would have abundantly juſtified this way of Explication, followed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with reſpect to the Tabernacle of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>It is hard to conceive how the Apoſtles could ſpeak of things which came to paſs in Old time, as Types of what ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in the Perſon of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other proof than their ſimple affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: As for inſtance, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould repreſent Chriſt as a New <hi>Noah,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 21. and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould propoſe <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> as a Type of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in reſpect to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Office, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi, vii. unleſs the <hi>Jews</hi> did allow this for a Maxim, which flows na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally from the Principle we have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing; namely, that theſe Great Men were look'd on as the Perſons in whom God would fulfil his firſt Promiſe; but that not being completely fulfilled in them, it was neceſſary
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93550:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> for them that would underſtand it aright to carry their View much farther, to a Time and Perſon without compariſon more auguſt; in whom the Promiſe ſhould be perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted.</p>
               <p>It may be demanded, why the Prophecies ſeem ſometime ſo applied to Perſons then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that one would think he ſhould not need to look any farther to ſee the fulfilling of them; as namely the prophetical Prayer, as in behalf of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which is in <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxii. as the Birth of a Son promiſed to <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> vii. and <hi>ch.</hi> ix. 6. and where <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſeems to ſpeak of himſelf, when he ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxi. 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> and the like. But it is not hard to give a reaſon for this; with which the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted. And it is this, That though all theſe Predictions had been directed to thoſe perſons, yet they had by no means their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in them, nor theſe perſons were in any degree intended and meant in the Prophecy. To be particular, <hi>Solomon</hi> was in Wars during the latter part of his Life; and ſo he could not be that <hi>King of Peace</hi> ſpoken of in the Prophecy; and his Kingdom was rent in his Son's time, the ſmaller part of it falling to his ſhare, as the greater was ſeized by <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> ſo far was the Kingdom of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> from being univerſal or everlaſting, <hi>Iſai.</hi> vii. 14. The Son born to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> neither had the Name of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> nor could he be the Perſon intended by it; as neither was his Mother a Virgin, as the word in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy ſignifies: And for the Prophet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though the Spirit of the Lord was upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93550:37"/> him, and ſpoke by him, as did it by all the other Prophets, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Yet that the Unction here ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Saadia Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Emunoth c. <hi>18</hi> &amp; D. Kimchi in rad. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lxi. 1. did not belong to him, but to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, and ſeems to have been ſo underſtood by thoſe that heard our Saviour apply this Prophecy to himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> iv. 22. So that nothing was more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly done, and more agreeable to the known Principles of the Synagogue, than the Queſtion propoſed to <hi>Philip</hi> by the Eunuch, who reading the liii. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> asked from him, <hi>Of whom did he ſpeak, of himſelf, or of another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, It may be asked, Why the Prophets called the Meſſias, <hi>David?</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt, Elias?</hi> Not to trouble the Reader with any more than a mention of that fancy of ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> that held the Tranſmigration of Souls; and ſay particularly, That the Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> went into <hi>David,</hi> and the Soul of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was the ſame with that of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> I ſay, to paſs by that, the true Reaſon of ſuch uſe of the Names of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> is this; becauſe <hi>David</hi> was an excellent Type of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was to come out of his Loins, <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 30, 31. And for <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> he came in the Spirit and Power of <hi>Elias, Luk.</hi> 1.17. That is, he was inſpired with the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Zeal and holy Courage that <hi>Elias</hi> was formerly acted with, and employ'd it, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, in bringing his People to Repentance and Reformation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ought to do the <hi>Jews</hi> that Juſtice as to acknowledge, that from them it is, that we know the true ſenſe of all the Prophecies
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93550:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in the Old Teſtament. Which ſenſe ſome Criticks ſeem not to be ſatisfied with, ſeeking for a firſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in other perſons than in the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> meaning and applying thoſe Prophecies to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in a myſtical or a ſpiritual ſenſe, is founded upon a Reaſon that offers it ſelf to the Mind of thoſe that ſtudy Scripture with attention.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, there was no time fixed for the Coming of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the giving of that Prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. there was no poſſibility of being deceived in the ſenſe of thoſe Prophecies which God gave from time to time, full of the Characters of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> It was neceſſary, 1. That the Kingdom ſhould be in <hi>Judah,</hi> and not ceaſe till the time about which they expected the Coming of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> 2. That the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Authority, called here the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> ſhould be alſo eſtabliſhed in <hi>Judah,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed before the Coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which we knew came to paſs by the Reign of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, and ſome years before the Death of our Saviour. And indeed the <hi>Talmudiſt</hi> ſay, that forty years before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the Houſe of the Sanctuary, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Blood were taken away from <hi>Iſrael. Talm. Jeruſ. l. Sanhedr. c. dine. mammonoth. &amp; Talm. Bab. C. Sanhedr. c. Hajou Bodekim.</hi> And <hi>Raymondus Martini,</hi> who writ this <hi>Pugio</hi> at the end of the XIIIth Century, quotes Part III. Diſt. 3. c. 16. §. 46. One <hi>R. Rachmon,</hi> who ſays, that when this happened, they <hi>put on ſackcloth, and pull'd off their hair, and ſaid, Wo unto us, the Scepter is departed from Iſrael, and yet the Meſſias is not come.</hi>

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93550:38"/>
               <p>And therefore they who had this Prophecy before them, could not miſtake <hi>David,</hi> nor <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> Nor could they deceive themſelves ſo far as to think this Title was applicable to <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> or any of his Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, there appeared not any one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> before the Times of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, that dared aſſume this Title of <hi>Meſſias;</hi> although the Name of <hi>Anointed,</hi> which the word <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſignifies, had been given to ſeveral of their Kings; as to <hi>David</hi> in particular. But ſince Jeſus Chriſt's coming, many have pretended to it. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, it is clear, that the Prophecies which had not, and could not have their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in thoſe, upon whoſe occaſion they were firſt delivered, were to receive their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe Prophecies ought neceſſarily to be referred to him.</p>
               <p>We ought by all means to be perſwaded of this. For we cannot think the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo void of Judgment as to imagine that the Apoſtles, or any one elſe in the World, had a right to produce the ſimple words of the Old Teſtament, and to urge them in any other ſenſe, than what was intended by the Writer, directed by the Holy Ghoſt: It muſt be his Senſe, as well as his Words, that ſhould be offered for proof to convince reaſonable Men. But we ſee that the <hi>Jews</hi> did yield to ſuch Proofs out of Scripture concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in which ſome Criticks do not ſee the force of thoſe Arguments that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to the <hi>Jews.</hi> They muſt then have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93550:38"/> believed that the true ſenſe of ſuch places was the literal ſenſe in regard of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom God had then in view at his inditing of theſe Books; and that it was not literal in reſpect of him, who ſeems at firſt-ſight to have been intended by the Prophecy.</p>
               <p>And now I leave it to the Conſideration of any unprejudiced Reader that is able to judge, Whether, if theſe Principles and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims I have treated of were unknown to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Apoſtles could have made any uſe of the Books of the Old Teſtament for their Conviction, either as to the Coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or the Marks by which he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable from all others, or as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of his Miniſtry. But this is a matter of ſo great importance, as to deſerve more pains to ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles did build upon ſuch Maxims as I have mentioned: And therefore any that call themſelves Chriſtians, ſhould take heed how they deny the force and authority of that way of Traditional interpretation, which has been anciently received in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>

               <head type="sub"> That Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles proved divers points of the Chriſtian Doctrine by this common Traditional Expoſition received among the Jews, which they could not have done, (at leaſt, not ſo well,) had there been only ſuch a Literal Senſe of thoſe Texts which they alledged, as we can find without the help of ſuch Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</head>
               <p>IF we make ſome reflections which do not require a great deal of Meditation, it is clear, that Jeſus Chriſt was to prove to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he was the Meſſias which they did expect many Ages ago, and whoſe Coming they look'd on as very near. He could not have done ſo if they had not been acquainted with their Prophetical Books, and with thoſe ſeveral Oracles which were contained in them. Perhaps there might have been ſome difference amongſt them concerning ſome of thoſe Oracles, becauſe there were in many of them ſome Ideas which ſeem contrary one to another. And that was almoſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt was to repreſent the Meſſias in a deep humiliation and great ſuffering, and in a great height of Glory. But after all, the method of calling the <hi>Jews</hi> was quite different from the method of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gentiles. They had the diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the chief Articles of Religion, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93550:39"/> the Heathen had not. They had all prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary for the deciding this great queſtion, Whether Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was the Meſſias, or not. They had the Sacred Books of the Old Teſtament, they were acquainted with the Oracles as well as with the Law. They longed after the coming of the Meſſias. They had been educated all along, and trained up in the expectation of him. They had not only thoſe Sacred Books in which the Meſſias was ſpoken of, but many among them had gathered the Ideas of the Prophets upon that ſubject, as we ſee by the Books of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus.</hi> And indeed we ſee that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpake to the <hi>Jews</hi> according to the Notions which were received among them. What I ſay will clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, if we reflect on ſome of the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by Chriſt and his Apoſtles from the Old Teſtament. For altho Jeſus Chriſt had in himſelf all the Treaſures of Wiſdom, and altho his Apoſtles were divinely inſpired, yet they ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> proportion what they ſaid to the capacity of their hearers. Their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were to move and diſpoſe them to the receiving of the Truth, but their proofs and arguments were the proper means to convince their hearers of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctrines of the Immortality of the Soul, and the Reſurrection from the Dead, being deny'd by the Sadducees, who required an expreſs Text of <hi>Moſes</hi> for the proof of thoſe Doctrines, and affirmed that there was not any ſuch to be found in the Writings of <hi>Moſes;</hi> our Saviour proves it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by theſe words, which ſtopped
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93550:40"/> their mouths, and raiſed the admiration of the multitude, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob; but God is not the God of the dead but of the living,</hi> Mat. xxii. 32. His proof was by a known and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence from that Text out of the Law, which he inferred according to the received method among the <hi>Jews.</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day do gather the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines from the ſame words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Mede <hi>his Works,</hi> p. 801.</note> 
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 6, 15, 16. which Jeſus Chriſt alledged to prove them by. The aſtoniſhment of the people on this occaſion did not proceed from the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his argument, as if they had never heard the like before; for they gathered alſo the Doctrine of the Reſurrection from <hi>Moſes</hi> his Song, as we ſee in <hi>Joſephus de Macchab.</hi> p. 1012. But it aroſe from another cauſe, to wit, his giving them ſuch a Spiritual notion of the Reſurrection as was not clogged with the difficulties drawn from that inſtance of a Woman's Marriage to more Husbands than one, which the <hi>Sadducees</hi> juſtly urged againſt that groſs Idea of a Reſurrection that many of them had, wherein Marriage and other actions of mortal life ſhould have place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Bleſſed Saviour in the ſame 22th. <hi>ch.</hi> of St. <hi>Matth. asked the Phariſees whoſe Son the Meſſias was to be?</hi> they anſwered, <hi>the Son of David, i. e.</hi> the Scripture ſaith, he ſhould deſcend from the Line of <hi>David.</hi> Againſt which Chriſt raiſes this Objection, <hi>How then does David in ſpirit,</hi> or inſpired by the Spirit, <hi>call him Lord?</hi> And he alledges for proof that <hi>David</hi> calls him Lord, the words of <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord ſit thou at my right
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93550:40"/> hand till I make thy enemies thy footſtool. If then David by the Spirit called him Lord, how is he then his Son?</hi> It appears that Jeſus Chriſt in making this Objection, did take theſe three things as granted by the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time. 1. That <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. was the work of the Prophet <hi>David.</hi> 2. That this Pſalm concerned the Meſſias. 3. That the name <hi>Adonai</hi> is in this place equivalent to the name <hi>Jehovah.</hi> There is not any of theſe things which the <hi>Jews</hi> will not diſpute at this day. But that their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did hold that theſe words were ſpoken to the Meſſias, it appears by their <hi>Midraſh</hi> on the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Saadia Gaon</hi> on <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13. Indeed their <hi>Targum</hi> juſtifies all that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid in this place, not only in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that this <hi>Pſalm</hi> was compoſed by <hi>David,</hi> but alſo that it was written for the Meſſias, who is therefore inſtead of <hi>Adonai</hi> called <hi>Memra,</hi> or the <hi>Word,</hi> according to <hi>Fagius</hi> his reading, which is moſt natural to the place. But that <hi>Memra,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> denotes the Meſſias, ſhall be ſhown in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> has taken the ſame way, <hi>Act.</hi> xiii. 24. where he quotes theſe words from <hi>Iſa.</hi> lv. 3. <hi>I will give you the ſure mercies of David.</hi> He refers this paſſage to the ſending of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, altho the Text ſeems obſcure enough for ſuch a reference. But he does it in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the explication given of it by the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> who underſtood this Chapter of the Meſſias. So does <hi>R. David Kimchi</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this verſe, and <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Sam. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niado,</hi> and <hi>R. Meir Ararma</hi> and <hi>Abarvanel.</hi> Upon the ſame ground he applies to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93550:41"/> in the ſame Chapter, the words of <hi>Pſal.</hi> xvi. 10. <hi>Thou wilt not leave thy holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> He proves that they could not be underſtood of <hi>David,</hi> ſeeing <hi>that his Sepulchre,</hi> the Monument of his Corruption, <hi>remained till that day.</hi> He ought firſt to have proved that this <hi>Pſalm</hi> was ſpoken of the Meſſias, and then have proved that it could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>David.</hi> But this method was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſince he went on this known Maxim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> That whatever <hi>Pſalm</hi> was not fulfilled in <hi>David,</hi> ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>Let us proceed to another clear proof of this Propoſition: St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 6. quotes a Text from <hi>Moſes</hi> Song, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 43. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the LXXth Verſion. 'Tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly believed that the Quotation is out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> xcvii. 8. but the very words, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> are not found in that <hi>Pſalm.</hi> They are in the Greek of <hi>Moſes</hi> Song without the leaſt alteration, though it muſt be confeſſed they are not there in the Hebrew Text. I will not diſpute, whether the <hi>Jews</hi> have loſt out of their Bibles this part of the ancient Text, ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time. They may in their Vindication ſhew, that neither the <hi>Samaritans</hi> have in their Text this Quotation, which is extant in the LXX. It ſeems therefore that this Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> was copied ſeparately from the reſt of the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch, for their convenience who were to learn it by heart; to which ſome pious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple added a few Verſes out of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> that concerned the ſame Subject. Which Copy,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93550:41"/> with the Additions, was tranſlated by the LXX, becauſe the People had generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this to their Memory. What I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence is this, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> made no difficulty to quote words that were only in the LXX Verſion, becauſe they contained things conformable to the ancient Sentiments of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and following the Genius and Doctrine prevailing in his Nation, he referrs theſe words to the ſecond Appearance of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> when all the Angels of God ſhall pay him adoration.</p>
               <p>If we read St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Citation, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 8, 16 of the Promiſe God made to <hi>Abraham, that in his ſeed all the nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> which he underſtands of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> we ſhall quickly judge that he followed herein the ſenſe of the ancient Synagogue. I know the greateſt part of the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> do underſtand it of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> As if God had ſaid, All the Nations of the Earth ſhall wiſh their Friends the Bleſſing which God gave to <hi>Iſaac.</hi> But the Ancients under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it otherwiſe, as we can judge by the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> ch. xliv. 25. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it to the Calling of <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Sepher Chaſidim,</hi> §. 961. and to the abode of the <hi>Sekinah</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it is explained by <hi>R. Joſeph de Carniſol Saare Iſider, fol.</hi> 3. <hi>col.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 4. <hi>col.</hi> 1. And ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſuppoſes it to be ſpoken of the Meſſias, <hi>Act.</hi> iii. 25.</p>
               <p>We may reflect in like manner on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe God made the People, <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 15. <hi>To raiſe them up a Prophet like unto Moſes:</hi> St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> makes uſe of it as being ſpoken of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93550:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that he ſhould give a new Law, <hi>Act.</hi> iii. 22. But the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> do all they can to evade this Application. Nevertheleſs, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been the Idea of the ancient Synagogue, becauſe we read that they ſpeak of the Law which was to be given by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as of a Law, in compariſon to which all other Law was to be lookt upon as meer Vanity. So <hi>Coheleth Rabba</hi> in <hi>c.</hi> ii. and in <hi>c.</hi> xi.</p>
               <p>It is not without ſome ſurprize that we read the Application St. <hi>Mat.</hi> ii. 15. has made of theſe words in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> xi. 1. <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my ſon;</hi> which ſeem only to be ſpoken of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and not of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And yet in the Book <hi>Midraſh Tehil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim Rabba</hi> on <hi>Pſ.</hi> ii. we may ſee the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> what is written of the People of <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> iv. 22. Which is an argument that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> cited this paſſage from <hi>Hoſea,</hi> according to the ſenſe the <hi>Jews</hi> gave it with reſpect to the Meſſias. <hi>The Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Meſſias are related in the Law, in the Prophets, and in the Books called Hagiographa</hi> [or in the <hi>Pſalms.] In the Law,</hi> Exod. iv. 22. <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael is my firſt-born: In the Prophets,</hi> Iſai. lii. 13. <hi>Behold my ſervant ſhall deal prudently. In the</hi> Pſalms, <hi>as it is written, The Lord ſaid to my Lord,</hi> Pſal. cx. i.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Matth.</hi> viii. 17. referrs the words of <hi>Iſai.</hi> liii. 4. to the miraculous Cures that Chriſt wrought. And he follows herein the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Tradition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which taught that the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſpoken of in this Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſhould pardon Sins, and conſequently heal their diſtempers, which were the effects
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93550:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> and puniſhments of their Sins. From hence it follows, that, according to their Tradition, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be God, even as Jeſus Chriſt did then ſuppoſe, when he healed the Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Man by his own power, <hi>Matth.</hi> ix. 6. and proves that he did not blaſpheme in forgiving Sins, which the <hi>Jews</hi> thought belonged only to God.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Matth.</hi> i. 23. applies the words of <hi>Iſai.</hi> vii. 14. to Chriſt's being born of a Virgin. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bring forth a ſon,</hi> &amp;c. This he did likewiſe according to the ancient Idea of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was not quite loſt in the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor. For <hi>R. Akiba,</hi> who lived and died under his Reign, makes the following Reflection on this Prophecy. He had conſidered that <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the beginning of the following Chapter, received Order from God to take to him two Witneſſes, <hi>Uriah</hi> the Prieſt who lived in his time, and <hi>Zechary</hi> the Son of <hi>Berachiah,</hi> who lived not (as he thought) till under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple. Upon which he ſaith, that God commanded the Prophet to do thus, to ſhew, that as what he had foretold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz</hi> was true by the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Uriah,</hi> who ſaw it accompliſh'd; ſo what he had foretold concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Delivery of a Virgin, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed under the ſecond Temple by the Witneſs of <hi>Zechary,</hi> who lived then. See <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara. tit. Maccoth. c.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſee that Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 21, &amp;c. alludes tacitly to the Prophecy of <hi>Mal.</hi> i. 11. concerning the Sacrifices of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is a matter at preſent contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93550:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> between <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> But Chriſt deliver'd the ſenſe of the Synagogue, as it is evident from the <hi>Targum</hi> on thoſe words of <hi>Malachy,</hi> which applies them to the Times of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. One would think it were only by way of Similitude that Chriſt applied to himſelf the Hiſtory of the Brazen Serpent, in ſaying, <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 14. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up.</hi> But there appears to be more in it than ſo. The ancient <hi>Jews</hi> lookt upon the Brazen Serpent as a Type of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſo we find by their <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> xxi. 8. which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this Serpent which <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up, by the Word of the Lord, who is alſo called <hi>God, Wiſd.</hi> xvi. 7. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> xv. 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Philo,</hi> while he hunts for Allegories, gives another Idea of it, <hi>de Agric. p.</hi> 157.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It may alſo ſeem to be only by way of Alluſion, that Chriſt calls himſelf the Bread that came down from Heaven, alluding to the <hi>Manna</hi> which came down from Heaven, as we read <hi>Exod.</hi> xvi. But he that looks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers ſhall find that herein alſo our Saviour followed the common <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Idea. For <hi>Philo,</hi> who writ in <hi>Egypt</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt began to preach, tells us poſitively that the Word or <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 1.5. cites God's Words to <hi>David</hi> concerning one that ſhould come out of his Loins, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vii. 14. <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son,</hi> as if they reſpected the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> How could he do thus?

                  <hi>holy, undefiled, harmleſs, ſeparate from Sinners;</hi> and on the other hand in that Promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> God takes it for granted that that Son of his might be a Sinner, and thereupon threatens in the very next words, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vii. 14. <hi>If he commit iniquity, I will chaſten him with the rod of men;</hi> which ſuits well with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> but not at all with the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The reaſon is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> followed the ſenſe of this place, which was commonly received among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who as they refer to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxii, cx. and cxxxii. where the ſame Ideas occur, ſo they muſt have referred to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whatever is great in this Prophecy; and to others, whatever therein denotes humane infirmities. And Indeed it was not very hard to give to that Oracle a further proſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> 1ſt.

               <p>St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> iv. 29. alludes to the Hiſtory in <hi>Gen.</hi> xxi. 9. as a Type of the Perſecutions which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould exerciſe on the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> Whereon does he build this? Firſt having proved it his way, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church was typified in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Son of the Free-woman, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the Fleſh, by <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Son of the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93550:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> and having thus brought unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s place, he proceeds upon the Old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation recited in <hi>Baal-Hatturim,</hi> that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhould pierce <hi>Iſaac</hi> with an Arrow, which they illuſtrate by <hi>Gen.</hi> xvi. 12. inſtead whereof the Text ſaith only, that he laughed at, or mocked <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> x. 6. applies to the Goſpel thoſe words of <hi>Deut.</hi> xxx. 11, 12, 13, 14. which ſeem to be ſpoken of the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews.</hi> But then the Old Synagogue applied theſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the times of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as is clear from <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum</hi> on the place, which is enough to juſtify St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Uſage of the words.</p>
               <p>We read in the Song of <hi>Zacharias, Luk.</hi> 1.69. that theſe words are referred to the <hi>Meſſias, he hath exalted the horn of his Anointed.</hi> The very ſame words are pronounced by <hi>Hannah,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 10. where the <hi>Targum</hi> referrs them in like manner as the ſenſe of the Synagogue.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Targum</hi> underſtands of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> that paſſage 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiii. 3. And the lxx have the like Idea with the <hi>Targum,</hi> which is a farther Confirmation of the Tradition of the Synagogue.</p>
               <p>It is certain this Notion of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was very common among the <hi>Jews;</hi> otherwiſe they would not have thruſt it into their <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums</hi> on places where naturally it ought not to come in. For inſtance. It is ſaid 1 <hi>Kings</hi> iv. 33. That <hi>Solomon diſcourſed of all the Trees, from the Cedar of Libanus, even to the Hyſſop that ſpringeth out of the Wall.</hi> Now the Remark of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93550:44"/> the <hi>Targum</hi> hereupon is this, And he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied touching the Kings of the Houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> which ſhould rule in this preſent World, as alſo in the World to come of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. We ſee our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to inſtruct the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of the two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Characters of the Coming of the <hi>Meſſias, Luk.</hi> xvii. 20. Of which the one was to be obſcure, and followed with the Death of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> the other was to be glorious, and acknowledged by the whole World. Chriſt inſtructed them in this the rather, to remove their miſtakes through which they confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his two Comings. Though in truth they were both of them confeſſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> for ſome time after Chriſt's aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We ſee that Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxi. 16. and alſo his Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 27. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 6, 7, 8. apply the words of <hi>Pſal.</hi> viii. to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> How could they do it, were it not before the ſenſe of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue? Now that ſuch was the ſenſe of the Synagogue, ye ſee till this day, if we read what they ſay in their <hi>Rabboth</hi> upon the <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> ch. iv. 1. and upon <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> ch. ix. 1. that the Children were to make Acclamations at the Coming in of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the ſecond Redeemer, according to thoſe words of <hi>Pſal.</hi> viii. 3. <hi>Ex ore infantium, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, We ſee St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> x. 18. does refer the words of <hi>Pſal.</hi> xix. 4. to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtles; and ſaith, <hi>Their ſound went over all the Earth, and their words to the end of the World.</hi> What would an unbelieving <hi>Jew</hi> have ſaid to this, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould apply
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93550:45"/> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s words in this manner? But the Apoſtle was ſecure againſt this or any other Objection from the <hi>Jews,</hi> if he uſed the words in the ſenſe of their Synagogue. And that he did ſo, there is little reaſon to doubt. The Encomiums which <hi>David</hi> gave to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they would moſt readily apply to the Law of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And they expected he ſhould have his Apoſtles to carry his Law throughout the World. To this expectation of theirs the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s words were very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable. That the Divine <hi>Word</hi> is called the Sun, <hi>Philo</hi> plainly affirms; and if I take <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> aright, he underſtands that it was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was called the <hi>Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Mal.</hi> iv. 2. St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw Chriſt in that figure of the Sun, and his Apoſtles as twelve Stars, and that in Heaven, which to him is the ſtate of the Goſpel, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 1.</p>
               <p>According to this figure, in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Sun of Righteouſneſs is deſcribed as a <hi>Giant,</hi> which rejoyceth to run a Race, <hi>v.</hi> 5. And here is a deſcription of his Courſe, together with that of his Diſciples, and of the manner by which they made their Voices to be heard. This Idea ſhocked <hi>R. Samuel</hi> in a Book he writ before his Converſion, <hi>ch.</hi> 18. which he communicated with a <hi>Rabin</hi> of <hi>Morocco.</hi> And whoever conſiders that Idea of the Writer of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> xviii. 5. ſhall find it is no other than that of this xixth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> mixed a little with that Idea in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> which the Old <hi>Jews</hi> refer to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and with that of the Song of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> v. touching the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which ſerved the <hi>Jews</hi> for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary to underſtand the <hi>Song of Solomon</hi> by.</p>

               <p>I could gather a much greater number of Remarks on this Head; but having brought as many here together, as I take to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the proving of what I have ſaid, I think I ought not to enlarge any further. So I come next to ſearch out the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, where we may find theſe Traditions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles made uſe of, either in explaining or confirming the Doctrines of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>They muſt be found in the ancient Books of the <hi>Jews</hi> which remain among us, ſuch as the Apocryphal Books, the Books of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſes on the Old Teſtament. The Authority of all theſe ought to be well eſtabliſhed. Let us begin by the Apocryphal Books, ſome of which Mr. <hi>N.</hi> hath ridiculed very boldly.

               <head type="sub">Of the Authority of the Apocryphal Books of the Old Teſtament.</head>
               <p>ALthough the Proteſtants have abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected the Apocryphal Books of the Old Teſtament, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> make uſe of in Controverſies, as if they were of the ſame authority with the Books of the Law and Prophets, notwithſtanding they keep them as Books of a great antiquity. And we make uſe of their authority, not to prove any Doctrine which is in diſpute, as if they contained a Divine Revelation, and a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an inſpired Writer, but to witneſs what was the Faith of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in the time when the Authors of thoſe Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books did flouriſh. Any body who ſees the <hi>Socinians</hi> making uſe of the Authorities of <hi>Artemas,</hi> or of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> to prove that the Chriſtian Church was in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt grant the ſame authority to the Books of <hi>Wiſdom, Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> and the like, touching the Sentiment of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in the age of thoſe Writers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grotius,</hi> a great Author for the <hi>Socinians,</hi> was ſo well ſatisfied of the truth of what I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, that he thought fit to Comment thoſe very Apocryphal Books, and to ſhew that they followed almoſt always the Ideas and the very words of the Authors of the Old Teſtament. But as he was a Man of a deep
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93550:46"/> ſenſe, ſeeing that they might be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Socinian</hi> cauſe, which he favoured too much, he did things which he judged fit to make their authority uſeleſs againſt the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi> And firſt he advanced without any proof, that thoſe things which were ſo like to the Ideas of the New Teſtament, had been inſerted in thoſe Books by Chriſtians, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their notions, and not according to the notions of the Synagogue. 2ly, He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to give another ſenſe to the places, which ſome Fathers in the ſecond and third Century had quoted from theſe Books to prove the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Divinity of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Now ſince the <hi>Socinian</hi> Authors have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, againſt the authority of theſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Books, the very Solutions which <hi>Grotius</hi> made uſe of to leſſen their authority, it is neceſſary, being reſolved to quote them for the ſettling of the Jewiſh Tradition, to ſhew how much <hi>Grotius,</hi> whoſe ſteps the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> trod in, was out in his Judgment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then I ſuppoſe with <hi>Grotius,</hi> that thoſe Apocryphal Books were written by ſeveral <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors, many years before Jeſus Chriſt appeared.</p>
               <p>The third Book of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> which is indeed the firſt, hath been written by a <hi>Jew</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> under <hi>Ptolomaeus Philopater,</hi> that is, about two hundred years before the Birth of our Saviour: It contains the Hiſtory of the Perſecution of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was cited by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Book <hi>de Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:93550:47"/>
               <p>The firſt Book of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> as we call it now, hath been written in <hi>Judea</hi> by a <hi>Jew,</hi> and originally in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which is loſt many Centuries ago. We have the tranſlation of it, which hath been quoted by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who gives often the ſame acccount of things as we have in that Book. It hath been written pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably 150. years before the Birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Book of <hi>Macchabees</hi> hath ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally been written in <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and is but an extract of the four Books of <hi>Jaſon</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who had writ the Hiſtory of the Perſecutions which the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Paleſtina</hi> ſuffered under the Reign of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanés</hi> and his Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>The Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> hath been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Originally in <hi>Hebrew</hi> by <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Syrac,</hi> about the time of <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus,</hi> that is, about 280. years before Jeſus Chriſt, and was Tranſlated in <hi>Greek</hi> by the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Syrac,</hi> under <hi>Ptolomy Euergetes.</hi> Some diſpute if that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is the firſt or the ſecond, which is not very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, ſince there is but a difference of 100. years. <hi>R. Azaria de Rubeis</hi> in his Book <hi>Meor Enaiim, ch.</hi> 22. witneſſeth that <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> is not rejected now by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among them with an unanimous conſent; and <hi>David Ganz</hi> ſaith that they put it in old times among the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the <hi>Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphes.</hi> So in his <hi>Tſemac David, ad A.</hi> 3448.</p>
               <p>The Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his Judgment is more ancient, having been written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> under <hi>Simon</hi> the High-Prieſt, who flouriſhed under <hi>Ptolomeus Lagus.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93550:47"/> Grotius</hi> thinks that the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation we have of that Book was made by ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian who hath foiſted into that Book many things, which belong more to a Chriſtian Writer, than a <hi>Jew.</hi> He raiſes ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt the Tranſlator of <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> But it is very eaſie to confute ſuch a bold Conjecture: Firſt, becauſe that Book was in <hi>Chaldaick</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> till the Thirteenth Century, as we ſee by <hi>Ramban</hi> in his Preface upon the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and they never objected ſuch an Interpolation, but lookt upon it as a Book that was worthy of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and probably his Works. It was the Judgment of <hi>R. Azarias de Rubeis,</hi> in the laſt Century <hi>Imre bina, ch.</hi> 57.</p>
               <p>The Epiſtle of <hi>Baruch</hi> and of <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſeem to <hi>Grotius</hi> the Writings of a Pious <hi>Jew,</hi> who had a mind to exhort his People to avoid Idolatry. And 'tis very probable that it was Penned under the Perſecutions of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when it was not ſure to any to write in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion under his own name.</p>
               <p>The Book of <hi>Tobith</hi> ſeems to have been writ originally in <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> and was among the <hi>Jews</hi> in St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time, who knowing not the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue called for a <hi>Jew</hi> to his aſſiſtance to render it into <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that ſo he might render it in <hi>Latin,</hi> as he ſaith in his Preface to <hi>Chromatius</hi> and <hi>Heliodorus. Grotius</hi> ſuppoſes the Book to be very ancient; Others believe, but without any ground, that it was Tranſlated into <hi>Greek</hi> by the Seventy; So that it would have been writ more than 250. years before Jeſus Chriſt. Whatſoever
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93550:48"/> Conjecture we may form upon the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it, it is certain it was in great eſteem among Chriſtians in the ſecond Century, ſince we ſee that <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> have followed his fancy of ſeven crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Angels about the Throne of God, and took that Doctrine for a Truth, although we ſee no ſuch Idea among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who have the Tranſlation of that Book, but do not now conſider it very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks that the Book of <hi>Judith</hi> contains not a true Hiſtory, but an Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Comment of the Author, who lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Antiochus Epiphanés,</hi> before the Profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Temple by that Tyrant, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation to expect a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deliverance from ſuch a Tyranny, which they groaned under: And we ſee no reaſon to diſcard ſuch a Conjecture, although <hi>R. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarias</hi> thinks <hi>Imre bina, ch.</hi> 51. that this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory was alluded to in the Book of <hi>Eſdras, ch.</hi> 4.15. He judges the ſame of the Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Book of <hi>Daniel, viz.</hi> the Prayer of <hi>Azaria,</hi> the Song of the Three Children in the Furnace, and of the Hiſtory of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi> he looks upon them as written by ſome <hi>Helleniſt Jew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Additions to the Book of <hi>Eſther,</hi> he judges to be the work of ſome <hi>Helleniſt,</hi> who invented the Story, which were afterwards admitted among the Holy Writings, becauſe they were Pious, and had nothing which could be lookt upon as contrary to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith nothing of the third and fourth of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and hath not judged them fit to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93550:48"/> be Commented, probably becauſe they are not accounted in the Canon of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeed the fourth is only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in <hi>Latin.</hi> But after all a Man muſt have viewed the third with very little judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who cannot perceive, firſt, that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the work of an ancient <hi>Jew</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt his time. 2ly, That it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> as a Book of great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>Joſephus p.</hi> 362. follows the Authority of that third Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> in the Hiſtory of <hi>Zorobabel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have not ancienter Writers than <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> who have quoted the 4th. Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> ſo I am reſolved not to make any uſe of it.</p>
               <p>The Antiquity and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Origin of all theſe Books that we call Apocryphal, being ſo ſettled, there is nothing to be done but to conſider what is the ground of the Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who pronounces boldly in his Preface to the Book of <hi>Wiſdom: Eum li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum nactus Chriſtianus aliquis Graecè non indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus in Graecum vertit, libero nec ineleganti di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi genere, &amp; Chriſtiana quaedam commodis locis addidit, quod &amp; libro Syracidae quem dixi evenit, ſed in Latino huic magis quam in Graeco, non quod neſciam poſt Eſdram explicatius proponi caepiſſe patientiam piorum, judicium univerſale, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam aeternam, ſupplicia gehennae, ſed quia locu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones quaedam magis Evangelium ſapiunt quam vetuſtiora tempora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſpeak my mind plainly, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of <hi>Grotius</hi> is abſolutely falſe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground. 1. Whence had he this
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93550:49"/> particular account of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith and Religion in the time of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> ſo as to be able to judge by it which was written long after <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and to ſhew that the Notions of theſe Books are clearer than the Ideas which were among the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt? He goes only upon that Principle, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince they were under the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire began to be more acquainted with the Ideas of the Eternal Life, and of Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and of the laſt Judgment, than they were before, which is the Principle of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and of his Followers, but that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had much clearer Ideas of thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſince <hi>Eſdras</hi> his time.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Is it not an intolerable boldneſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thoſe Books of having been ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polated, without giving any proof of it, but his meer Conjecture? I confeſs there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral various Readings in thoſe Books as there are in Books which having been of a general uſe, were tranſcribed many times by Copiſts of different induſtry, one more exact and more learned than the other. But to ſay that a Chriſtian hath interpolated them deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a thing which can no more be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than to ſuppoſe that they have corrupted the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Books of the Old Teſtament, to which thoſe Books were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Greek</hi> Bible as ſoon as it came into the hands of the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. To ſuppoſe that a Chriſtian hath been the Author of the Tranſlation of ſome of thoſe Books, is a thing advanced with great abſurdity, ſince there was a Tranſlation of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93550:49"/> theſe Books quoted by <hi>Philo</hi> and by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles. Now I would ask from <hi>Grotius</hi> how he can prove that there was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Verſion of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> made by a Chriſtian after Jeſus Chriſt? what was the need of it, ſince there was one before Jeſus Chriſt? And if any Chriſtian did undertake ſuch a new one without neceſſity, how it came to paſs that it was received inſtead of the Verſion which was in uſe amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and was added to the Books of Scripture, and of the Copies which were in the hands of Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>I need not to urge many other abſurdities againſt <hi>Grotius</hi> his Conjecture. I take notice only, 1. That <hi>Grotius</hi> was far from ridiculing the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as the <hi>Socinian</hi> Author of the Book againſt Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> hath done in his Judgment of the Fathers.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That the ridiculing of ſuch an Author as the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſheweth very little Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Mr. <hi>N.</hi> He had better have made uſe of the Gloſſes of <hi>Grotius,</hi> than to venture upon ſuch rough handling of an Author quoted by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe quoting him giveth him more credit, than he can loſe by a thouſand cenſures of a Man who writes ſo injudiciouſly.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. That the very place which Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicules is ſo manifeſtly taken from the <hi>Pſalm</hi> xix. which contains a Prophecy touching the Meſſias, and from the Song of <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> 5. that whoſoever reflects ſeriouſly upon ſuch a ridiculing of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> made by Mr. <hi>N.</hi> can't but have a mean notion of his ſenſe of Religion.</p>
               <p>After all let Mr. <hi>N.</hi> do what he can with the Conjecture of <hi>Grotius,</hi> I am very little
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93550:50"/> concerned in his Judgment; Firſt, becauſe the matter which we are to handle is not the matter which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſuſpects to have been foiſted in by ſome Chriſtian Interpreter. 2ly. Becauſe I am reſolved to make uſe in this Controverſie only of thoſe places of the Apocryphal Books in which they expreſs the ſenſe of the Old Synagogue before Jeſus Chriſt, as I ſhall juſtifie they have done by the conſent of the ſame Synagogue after Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and no body can ſuſpect with any probability of the Old Synagogue that they have borrowed the Ideas of Chriſtians, and have inſerted them in their ancient Books, written ſo long time before Jeſus Chriſt's Birth.</p>

               </head>
               <head type="sub">That the Works which go under the name of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> are truly his; and that he writ them a long while before the time of Chriſt's Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and that it does not appear in any of his Works that ever he had heard of Chriſt, or of the Chriſtian Religion.</head>
               <p>TO ſhew the Judgment of the Ancient Synagogue in the Points controverted between us, and the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> we make great uſe of the Writings of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew;</hi> which if they are his, it cannot be denied, do put this matter out of Queſtion. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries therefore, as it greatly concerns them, do deny that thoſe Works which bear his name, were written by <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By whom then were they written? They ſay by another <hi>Philo</hi> a Chriſtian, who lived toward the end of the ſecond Century, and who, as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ſaith, counterfeited the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the famous <hi>Philo</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who was ſent Embaſſadour to <hi>Caligula</hi> by thoſe of his own Nation in the year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to refute this Suggeſtion of theirs. And yet I cannot but acknowledge it has ſome kind of colour, from that which we read in <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> who tell us, that <hi>Philo</hi> has given a Character of the Apoſtolick Chriſtians in his Book <hi>de Therapeutis:</hi> To
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93550:51"/> which ſome have added, that at his ſecond coming to <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Claudius,</hi> to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour at his Court, as he was before at <hi>Caligula</hi>'s, he then became acquainted with St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I am therefore to prove theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That thoſe Books we have under the name of <hi>Philo,</hi> are the Works of a <hi>Jew,</hi> of whom there is not the leaſt appearance in his Writings that he knew any thing of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, nor that he ever heard of Jeſus Chriſt or his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it appears by the Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they were written before Jeſus Chriſt began to Preach.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is no foundation for what <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays, and alſo St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied from <hi>Euſebius,</hi> concerning <hi>Philo</hi>'s account of a ſort of Chriſtians, whom he deſcribes under the name of <hi>Therapeutae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Hiſtory of the Converſation between St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> is a ridiculous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> took upon hear-ſay, from he knew not whom, or from an Author, whom he did not think fit to name, for fear it ſhould give no credit to his Story.</p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition, namely, That theſe Pieces were written by one that was a <hi>Jew</hi> by Religion, this one cannot doubt of, if he conſiders theſe following things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in all theſe Pieces of <hi>Philo,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he has occaſion to make uſe of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he fetches it only out of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:93550:51"/> Scriptures. And thoſe are the only Scriptures that he takes upon him to explain. He quotes <hi>Moſes</hi> (whom he uſually calls the Law-giver), as we do the Sayings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And ſometimes, tho very rarely, he quotes other Writings of the Old Teſtament. But I dare affirm that in all his Treatiſes, he cites not one paſſage from the New Teſtament, which thing alone is ſufficient to prove that he was no Chriſtian. For the firſt Chriſtians uſed to cite the New Teſtament with as much care, and even affection, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the Old.</p>
               <p>But, Secondly, one had need have an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination as ſtrong as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> to fancy that a Chriſtian Author in the end of the Second Century could write, as <hi>Philo</hi> does, upon moſt part of the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> without mixing ſome touches at leaſt at the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet there is no ſuch thing in all <hi>Philo</hi>'s Works. He takes it for his buſineſs to make the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtand their Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Midraſhim</hi> in an Allegorical way, and to teach the Heathens that their prejudices againſt the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and that they ought to acknowledg the Divinity of this Law, which he explained to them. This is the end or deſign of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in all his Works.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. It appears that he, according to the opinion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, did expect the Meſſias as a great Temporal King yet to come, as is evident from the Interpretation he gives of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Prophecy touching the Meſſias in his Book <hi>de Praemiis, p.</hi> 716.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. In all his Works there is nothing peculiar to Chriſt that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> can alledg, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93550:52"/> in what is written of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the very thing in diſpute between us and him; but even that doth not hinder, but that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves finding every thing in <hi>Philo</hi> ſo agreeable to the Notions that their Anceſtors had in his Age, do own them to be the Writings of a <hi>Jew,</hi> and of <hi>Philo</hi> in particular. As we ſee in <hi>Manaſſeh ben Iſrael,</hi> who in many places alledges his Authority,<note place="margin">In <hi>Exod.</hi> p. 137.</note> and ſhews that his Opinions do generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with thoſe of their moſt ancient Authors.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I have to ſhew is, that it appears from the Books themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſe that many of them were compoſed before Jeſus Chriſt began to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Chriſt's Preaching began in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> in the year of the Building of <hi>Rome</hi> 783. But the Author of the Book, <hi>Quod omnis probus ſit Liber,</hi> which has always been accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtely <hi>Philo</hi>'s, does note, that the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reſiſtance of thoſe of <hi>Xanthus</hi> in <hi>Lycia</hi> againſt <hi>M. Brutus,</hi> was an affair freſh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as having happened, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not much before the writing of that Book. Now this which he tells us of the <hi>Xanthians,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not long after the death of <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> who was killed on the 13th. of <hi>March</hi> in the year of <hi>Rome</hi> 709, for <hi>Brutus</hi> himſelf was kill'd at the time of the Battel of <hi>Philippi,</hi> which was in <hi>Autumn</hi> in the year 712. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Philo</hi> could not ſay, it happened not long ſince, if he writ ſo long after as in the year, <hi>Urb. Con.</hi> 783. when Chriſt began to Preach; for according to the common manner of ſpeaking, no man could ſay a thing happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long ſince, that happened before the remembrance of any man then living.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:93550:52"/>
               <p>But if that Book was writ before Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach the Goſpel, much more were all thoſe Books which we make uſe of againſt the <hi>Unitarians:</hi> for according to the Order, in which theſe Books are rankt by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> this Book, <hi>Quod omnis probus eſt Liber,</hi> was one of the laſt that <hi>Philo</hi> writ. The firſt that <hi>Euſebius</hi> names were the Three Books of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories; after which he goes on to the Books of Queſtions and Anſwers upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and upon <hi>Exodus;</hi> he tells us beſides, That <hi>Philo</hi> took pains to examine particular difficulties, which might ariſe from ſeveral Hiſtories in thoſe Books; and names the ſeveral Books that <hi>Philo</hi> writ of this ſort. This Order of his Books was obſerved in the Manuſcripts, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath exactly followed; and it is agreeable enough to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Method of handling the Scripture by way of Queſtions and Anſwers, which is ſtill the Title of many <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Books of this Nature.</p>
               <p>We may gather the ſame truth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of <hi>Philo,</hi> which tells us expreſly that he ſtudi'd the Scriptures, <hi>Primâ aetate,</hi> when he was young; and he complains of being called afterwards to publick buſineſs; and that he had not now leiſure to attend to the ſtudy of the Scriptures, as formerly [<hi>Lib. de Leg. ſpec. p.</hi> 599.] Therefore all his Books before were written in his younger days, and eſpecially his Three Books of Allegories, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> placeth firſt before any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his <hi>Antiq. Lib.</hi> xviii. <hi>c.</hi> 10. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, That <hi>Philo</hi> was the Chief and moſt conſiderable of the <hi>Jews</hi> employed by thoſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93550:53"/> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the Embaſſy to <hi>Caligula.</hi> This man, ſaith he, eminent among thoſe of his Nation, appeared before <hi>Caligula</hi> his Death, which was, <hi>A. U. C.</hi> 793. That is to ſay, in the 40th year of our Lord. Now <hi>Philo,</hi> in the Hiſtory of his Legation to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi> ſays of himſelf, That he was at that time all grey with Age, that is, 70 years old, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Notion of a man with grey hair, <hi>Pirke Avoth. c.</hi> 5. Suppoſe then that he was 70 years old when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before <hi>Caligula,</hi> it follows that he was born in the year of <hi>Rome</hi> 723. Suppoſe alſo that he began to write at 30 years old, it will fall in with the year of <hi>Rome</hi> 793. That is to ſay 30 years before Chriſt preach'd in <hi>Judaea.</hi> For Jeſus Chriſt began not to preach till the year of <hi>Rome</hi> 783.</p>
               <p>The Third Aſſertion is as eaſy to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For though <hi>Baronius</hi> makes much of that fancy of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who, to prove the Antiquity of Monaſtic Life, held that <hi>Philo</hi>'s <hi>Therapeutae</hi> were Chriſtians; and who was herein followed by St. <hi>Hierom</hi> without Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; yet others of the moſt Learned Papiſts, as particularly <hi>Lucas Holſtenius,</hi> and <hi>Hen. Valeſius</hi> have confeſt, that herein <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> was miſtaken. Indeed one need only read the Book <hi>de Therapeutis</hi> it ſelf, or even the firſt period of it, to be convinced that thoſe whom <hi>Philo</hi> there deſcribes, were the <hi>Jews</hi> of the <hi>Eſſen</hi> Sect, and the <hi>Eſſens</hi> were, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> plainly ſhews in the account he gives of them, as much <hi>Jews</hi> by Religion, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were. <hi>Photius,</hi> who was a better Critic than <hi>Euſebius,</hi> has very well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93550:53"/> his miſtake, and ſhewn, That the Book <hi>de Therapeutis</hi> deſcribes the Life of a Sect of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> It is a ſurprizing thing that <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſhould commit ſuch a miſtake, becauſe he himſelf in his Books <hi>de Praep. Evang.</hi> do's cite a long paſſage from <hi>Porphyry</hi> taken out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing whereof <hi>Euſebius</hi> could not but ſee many thing related of the <hi>Eſſens,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Philo</hi> brought into his account of the <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this it may be Objected; do's not <hi>Photius</hi> report that <hi>Philo</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, met with St. <hi>Peter</hi> there, and contracted a friendſhip with him, which occaſioned his writing that Book <hi>de Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutis,</hi> as of the Diſciples of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who was himſelf the Diſciple of St. <hi>Peter?</hi> Doth not <hi>Euſebius</hi> fix this meeting of <hi>Philo</hi> with St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> when he ſaith he read in full Senate his Book, Intituled, <hi>The Virtues of Caius Caligula;</hi> (Tho it was the ſcope of that Book to ſhew the impiety of that Monſter that would be worſhipped as a God) for which <hi>Philo</hi> was ſo much admired, that not only this but his other pieces were ordered to be put into the publick Library, as pieces of ſuch great value, that they were worthy to be preſerved for ever?</p>
               <p>I know all this, and do believe that <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> did not invent all this Hiſtory. But if there be any truth in it, they might be thoſe Books of <hi>Philo,</hi> which he writ againſt <hi>Flaccus</hi> (who died <hi>A. D.</hi> 38.) and the account of his Embaſſy to <hi>Caius,</hi> with three other Treatiſes containing the Sufferings of the <hi>Jews</hi> under
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93550:54"/> 
                  <hi>Caius,</hi> now loſt, that were put in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Library. For I cannot imagine, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate ſhould lay up in their publick Archives his other pieces, which regarded only the Laws of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for that which he tells us, that <hi>Philo</hi> ſaw St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there made an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, it is a meer dream of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who fancying that his Book <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapeutis</hi> was written in praiſe of the firſt Chriſtians of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that they were Diſciples of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> did go on to imagine, that he might poſſibly have ſome converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and ſo came to write in commendation of theſe firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. This meeting of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, (howſoever <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> fancied it as a thing that would give ſome colour to his Opinion concerning the <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutae</hi>) could not be true, becauſe, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Writings of the New Teſtament, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was as far from being at <hi>Rome</hi> in the 42d. year of our Lord, that is, in the ſecond year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>caligula,</hi> that he did not leave <hi>Judaea</hi> or <hi>Syria</hi> till after the Death of <hi>Agrippa</hi> (the ſame that impriſoned St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and) who died in the fourth of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius.</hi> All the Learned now a days know that St. <hi>Peter</hi> came not to <hi>Rome</hi> before the firſt year of <hi>Nero</hi> (if he came thither ſo early) <hi>i. e. A. D.</hi> 55. at which time it is neceſſary that <hi>Philo</hi> who was all Grey <hi>A. D.</hi> 40. and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was then about ſeventy years of age, ſhould be full eighty five years old, which is an age very unfit for travel or buſineſs, or even for living ſo far from ones own home, as <hi>Rome</hi> was from <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:93550:54"/>
               <p>This ſhews what credit may be given to this report in <hi>Photius,</hi> that <hi>Philo</hi> was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but afterward turned Apoſtate. So it is, all Errors are fruitful, and from one Fable there uſes to ariſe many more.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Euſebius</hi> he is the leſs to be excuſed for writing what he doth of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which he ſaith was firſt approved by St. <hi>Peter</hi> at this time of his being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and then made uſe of by St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> for the converting of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> whom <hi>Philo</hi> deſcribes under the name of <hi>Therapeutae.</hi> When as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſheweth us himſelf elſwhere in his Hiſtory, he had ſo great an Authority as that of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to aſſure him, that St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was not written till after St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Death. [<hi>Euſeb. Hiſt.</hi> v. 8.] All that can be ſaid for him, is only this, that when he was writing this paſſage of <hi>Philo,</hi> he did not think of what he had writ before. Indeed if he had thought of it, he had not been that man we take him for, if he had ſuffered it to paſs, as it ſtands now in his Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>I thought it was proper to enter into this diſquiſition concerning the Writings of <hi>Philo,</hi> and the time when they were written, that I might leave no doubt in the minds of my Readers, concerning the Authority of <hi>Philo,</hi> whom I intend to produce as an authentick Teſtimony of the Opinions of the Synagogue before our Lord, in the matters diſputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the <hi>Unitarians.</hi>

               <p>I Shall have occaſion, in many points, to cite the Paraphraſes of the <hi>Jews</hi> upon the Books of the Old Teſtament; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may appear ſtrange to ſome, that I oftentimes cite them without diſtinguiſhing between thoſe which paſs for ancient, and thoſe which are reputed by Criticks altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther modern. Therefore I think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged once for all to give the reaſons of my doing thus, and to ſatisfie my Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſpend time to diſcover the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of theſe Paraphraſes. It is enough to mind the Reader, that the <hi>Jews</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgot their <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, 'twas needful for the People's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Holy Scriptures, which were read in the Synagogue every Sabbath-day, that ſome perſons skilful both in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> ſhould explain to the People eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Verſe in <hi>Chaldee,</hi> after that they had read it to them in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> make this Practice as ancient as the times of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, <hi>Neh.</hi> viii. 8. as one may ſee in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> Title <hi>Nedarim, ch.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> all agree, that this way of Tranſlating the Scriptures was made by word
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93550:55"/> of mouth only for a long time. But it is hard to conceive that they which interpreted in that manner did write nothing for the uſe of Poſterity. It ſeems much more probable to believe, that from time to time theſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters writ ſomething, eſpecially on the moſt difficult places, and thoſe which were leaſt underſtood.</p>
               <p>The firſt, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers,<note place="margin">Magill. c. <hi>3.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> ſeem to agree that this <hi>Jonathan</hi> lived a 100. years before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that is to ſay, he lived in the reign of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, about thirty years before the Birth of our Lord. And ſome Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks believe our Saviour does cite his <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe <hi>Luc.</hi> iv. 18. in quoting the Text <hi>Iſa.</hi> lx. 2. Thus much may at leaſt be ſaid for it, that all that which is there cited, does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree better with his <hi>Targum,</hi> than with the Original Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onkelos</hi> a Proſelyte, was he according to their common account, who turned the five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> into <hi>Chaldee.</hi> This Work is rather a pure ſimple Tranſlation, than a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe; notwithſtanding it muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in divers places he does not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93550:56"/> ſo much to give us the Text word for word, as to clear up the ſenſe of certain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which otherwiſe could not well be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the people. This <hi>Onkelos</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaw <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and lived in the time of that ancient <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> who was Maſter of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as ſome would have it.</p>
               <p>We find in <hi>Megillah, c.</hi> 1. that he Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his <hi>Targum</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>R. Elie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> and of <hi>R. Joſua,</hi> after the year of our Lord 70, and that he died in the year of our Lord 108, and that his <hi>Targum</hi> was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately received into the publick uſe of the <hi>Jews;</hi> what other <hi>Targums</hi> there were on the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> having almoſt wholly loſt their credit and their authority.</p>
               <p>As to the other Sacred Books which the <hi>Jews</hi> call <hi>Cetouvim,</hi> or <hi>Hagiographes,</hi> they aſcribe the <hi>Targums</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> to <hi>R. Joſeph Caeeus,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that he lived a long time after <hi>Onkelos.</hi> And for the <hi>Targums</hi> of the other Books, they look on them as works of Anonymous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. However the moſt part of theſe <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums</hi> have been Printed under the name of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> as if he had been Author of them all.</p>
               <p>There are moreover ſome ſcraps of a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is called the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum;</hi> and there is another that bears the name of <hi>Jonathan</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and which ſome Learned <hi>Jews</hi> have ſaid to be his. As doth <hi>R. Azaria (Imrebinah, c.</hi> 25.) and the Author of the <hi>Chain of Tradition, p.</hi> 28. after <hi>R. Menahem
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93550:56"/> de Rekanati,</hi> who cites it under the name of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> following ſome Ancient MSS. Theſe <hi>Targums</hi> ordinarily exceed the bounds of a Paraphraſe, and enter into Explications, ſome of which are ſtrange enough, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the work of divers Commentators, who among ſome good things have very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mixed their own idle Fancies and Dreams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beckius</hi> nineteen years ago, publiſhed a Paraphraſe on the two Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> of which alſo there is a MSS. at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> This deſerves almoſt the ſame Character with theſe Paraphraſes I ſpoke of laſt. For the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this, as well as thoſe before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, does often intermingle ſuch Explications as taſte of the Commentator, with thoſe which appear to have been taken from the Ancient <hi>Peruſhim,</hi> or Explications of the moſt Eminent Authors of the Synagogue. A Man muſt be mighty credulous if he gives credit to all the fables which the <hi>Jews</hi> bring in their <hi>Talmud</hi> to extoll the authority of <hi>Jonathan</hi> his <hi>Targum,</hi> and he muſt have read theſe Pieces with very little attention or judgment, who ſhould maintain that they are entirely and throughout the Works of the Authors whoſe names they bear, or that they are of the ſame antiquity in reſpect of all their parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onkelos</hi> is ſo ſimple that it ſeems nothing, or very little, has been added to him, and he has been in ſo great eſteem among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they have commonly inſerted his Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the Text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> verſe for verſe, in the Ancient Manuſcripts of the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:93550:57"/> And from thence we may judge if there is any ground for the Conjecture of ſome <hi>Jews</hi> who would perſuade us that it is only an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jonathan</hi> upon the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch.</hi> Certainly <hi>Jonathan</hi> his <hi>Targum</hi> upon the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> muſt be of a very dubious ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ſince we ſee that the <hi>Zohar</hi> cites from it the firſt words which are not to be found in it, but in the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem, (fol.</hi> 79. <hi>col.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 17.) It is uncertain if the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> hath been a continued <hi>Targum,</hi> or only the Notes of ſome Learned <hi>Jew</hi> upon the Margent of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or an abridgment of <hi>Onkelos,</hi> for it hath a mixture of <hi>Chaldaick, Greek, Latin</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> words, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it hath been written in latter times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgment of <hi>R. Elias Levita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jonathan,</hi> who explained the former and the latter Prophets, has not been ſo happy as <hi>Onkelos,</hi> for it ſeems thoſe that Copied his <hi>Targum</hi> have added many things to it, ſome of which diſcover their Authors to have lived more than 700 years after him; one may alſo ſee there a medly of different <hi>Targum,</hi> of which the <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Iſai.</hi> xlix. is a plain inſtance.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Targums</hi> on all the other Holy Books which the <hi>Jews</hi> call the firſt Prophets, it is viſible that all their parts are not equally ancient. Thoſe which we have on <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> are ſimple enough and Literal. That on <hi>Ruth</hi> is full of Talmudical Ideas. The ſame judgment may be made of thoſe on the two Books of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Thoſe which we have on the two Books of <hi>Kings,</hi> are a little freer from additions. But that on <hi>Eſther</hi> is rather a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93550:57"/> Commentary, that collects ſeveral Opinions upon difficult places, than a Paraphraſe. In that on <hi>Job</hi> attributed to <hi>R. Joſeph</hi> in the <hi>Jews</hi> Edition at <hi>Venice</hi> in Folio, <hi>Anno</hi> 1515. there are divers <hi>Targums</hi> cited in expreſs Terms, as there are alſo in the <hi>Targum</hi> on the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which bears the name of <hi>R. Joſeph</hi> in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Edition of <hi>Venice.</hi> One may alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve many Additions in the <hi>Targums</hi> on the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> but eſpecially in that upon the <hi>Canticles,</hi> all which have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under the name of <hi>R. Joſeph.</hi> I have ſaid almoſt as much of that on the two Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> which <hi>Beckius</hi> publiſhed about eighteen or nineteen years ago.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, one may very well ask, with what juſtice do you aſcribe theſe Books to thoſe, who as the <hi>Jews</hi> now ſay, were the Authors of them? when by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <hi>Onkelos</hi> on the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is perhaps the only Tranſlator in whom you find none of theſe marks of corruption, which you acknowledg in the other <hi>Targums</hi> you quote. For the other <hi>Targums,</hi> it may be ſaid, that we ought to leave them out of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; unleſs we would impoſe the new Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the <hi>Jews</hi> that lived long after Chriſt's time, under the pretence of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the opinions of the ancient Synagogue before Jeſus Chriſt. One may inſiſt upon it that we are to quote the Books of <hi>Onkelos</hi> only, and lay the other aſide as Books of no authority, ſince we do confeſs, that they are full of Additions, in which there are many Fables and Viſions borrowed from the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudical <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:93550:58"/>
               <p>I might hope to ſatisfie any reaſonable Reader, that ſticks at this difficulty, by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: Firſt, in few words, that I will ſcarce ever cite any of theſe <hi>Targums,</hi> but when they ſay the ſame thing that <hi>Onkelos</hi> doth. And, ſecondly, that theſe as well as <hi>Onkelos</hi> are owned by the <hi>Jews.</hi> And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any colour of reaſon be imagined, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince Chriſt's time have adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Books contrary to their Religion, and uſed them in their common reading, as true Verſions of the Law and the Prophets. It is certain that the <hi>Jews</hi> many Centuries ago have taken them for ſuch. And therefore theſe Books in whatſoever time they were written, are ſufficient teſtimonies of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Synagogue.</p>
               <p>But I have ſomething more conſiderable to offer for the eſtabliſhing of the Authority of theſe Paraphraſes, as well as of that of <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelos</hi> in our diſpute with our <hi>Unitarians,</hi> againſt whom we ſhall have occaſion to make uſe of the Teſtimony of theſe Paraphraſes. For this one needs only examine theſe Paraphraſes with an ordinary attention. I pray therefore the Reader to conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whatſoever has been ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for the neceſſity that there was, for the making of theſe <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſes, the ſame does alſo confirm the antiquity of all theſe Paraphraſes; if not, as to every part of them, yet at leaſt, as to the main of theſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes, ſuch as we now have them almoſt on every Book of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. We ſee in the <hi>Miſna</hi> a clear mention made of ſome <hi>Targums</hi> upon the Law and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93550:58"/> the firſt Prophets, <hi>Megillah, cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9, <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. which muſt be <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. We read in the <hi>Gemarah</hi> of Sabbath, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>fol.</hi> 115. <hi>col.</hi> 1. an account of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> upon <hi>Job</hi> which <hi>Raban Gamaliel</hi> (the Grand-father to <hi>R. Judah,</hi> who compiled the <hi>Miſna</hi>) had read. Now if the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe on the Books of <hi>Job</hi> was in common uſe ſo anciently; who can doubt, but that they had the like Verſions alſo on the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and on the Prophets? Nay we ſee that Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs cites the xxii. <hi>Pſalm</hi> according to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, and not according to the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> This he did, that he might be underſtood by them that were preſent at that time; from whence it follows that the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Judea</hi> had a Paraphraſe of the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and that that Paraphraſe was already received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, before the time of our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>I know ſome Criticks will not allow the <hi>Miſnah</hi> which ſpeaks of the <hi>Targums</hi> to be ſo ancient as I do. Their great reaſon is, that this Book is cited by none of the Fathers who lived juſt after it was written, and that it is mentioned by no body before <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour his time. But this Objection proceeds only from an overſight of theſe Criticks, who have not obſerved, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſhould grant, what they ſuppoſe to be true, it would not weaken the Authority of the <hi>Miſnah,</hi> when the Author of the <hi>Miſnah</hi> does witneſs the antiquity of the <hi>Targums;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Miſnah</hi> is not a Book of a common form, but a collection of many old Deciſions, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93550:59"/> the Book of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> which is called <hi>Digeſtum,</hi> which is not <hi>Juſtinian</hi> his work, but his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; or as the Book of <hi>Gratian,</hi> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Decretum,</hi> which is nothing but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation of Canons, or Deciſions of Fathers, who lived ſix or ſeven hundred years before <hi>Gratian.</hi> That hath been judiciouſly remark'd by <hi>Paul</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi> in the Preface to his <hi>Scrutinium,</hi> and in this judgment he follows <hi>Maymonides</hi> in his Preface upon his <hi>Jad Kazaka.</hi> And indeed we muſt obſerve that almoſt all the famous <hi>Rabins</hi> which are mentioned in the <hi>Miſnah</hi> are the very Men which are mentioned by St.<note place="margin">Com. on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Jerome</hi> as the great Authors of the <hi>Judaick</hi> Traditions.</p>
               <p>If the Learned Men do not like the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of <hi>R. Elias Levita</hi> upon the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but would have it to be the reſt of an entire work upon the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> Let them examine how it came to paſs that the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Paraphraſe on the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi> is almoſt all loſt. So that there remain only ſome few bits of it here and there on ſome Texts; and then they will find that perhaps it is not loſt, but that it ſubſiſts in great meaſure in that which is under <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> his name on the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> Whence it is probably that in ſome MSS. it bears the name of the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in other's the name of <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum:</hi> It is eaſie to judge how this came to paſs. The <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum differed from that of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> but in ſome places; or perhaps it was the very <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jonathan</hi> which was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented from time to time by divers Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Then when the <hi>Jews</hi> came to make
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93550:59"/> their Paraphraſe no longer than their Text, that they might have the Text and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe both together in their Bibles, they did not give themſelves the trouble to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Paraphraſe all at length; But they contented themſelves with tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing thoſe parts where it appeared to have ſome difference from that of <hi>Jonathan;</hi> and this they did after ſo ſcrupulous a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they tranſcribed the Paſſages of the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum,</hi> that agree in the ſenſe, and differ only in the words, as well as thoſe that have a different ſenſe from that of <hi>Jonathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know very well that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſpeak of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Paraphraſes, beſides that of <hi>Jonathan</hi> on the Prophets, and that of <hi>Onkelos</hi> on the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> As for inſtance, they ſpeak of a <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>R. Joſeph,</hi> who they ſay, has tranſlated the Books of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>But as to this it ought to be conſidered: 1. That it was the <hi>Jews</hi> Cuſtom to teach their Scholars theſe Paraphraſes not from a Book, but from their memory, and by heart; and ſo the Scholars might very well aſcribe to their Maſters, that which they had learnt from their mouths, and their verbal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as well as if it had been delivered to them in writing. 2. That the ſame places, which are quoted from the Paraphraſe of <hi>R. Joſeph</hi> on ſome Books of the Prophets, are to be found in expreſs terms in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, which the <hi>Jews</hi> eſteem more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient than <hi>Onkelos</hi> who writ on the Law. 3. <hi>R. Joſeph,</hi> whom they quote, does him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cite the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, as being of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93550:60"/> Authority in his time, and therefore it was not his work. And this appears from his Confeſſion, that he could never have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the words of <hi>Iſai.</hi> viii. 6. without the help of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, <hi>Gemara, ch.</hi> xi. <hi>tit. Sanbedr. fol.</hi> 95.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the antiquity of theſe Paraphraſes, I own they contain Additions very new, which ſhew that after they were written, they were in ſuch places enlarged with the Gloſſes of Doctors that applied themſelves to the Study of the Law, and took pains to ſhew how one part of it depended upon another; of which we find nothing in <hi>Onkelos,</hi> which is almoſt a verbal tranſlation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text into <hi>Chaldee.</hi> And thus, 1. we find in many places the connexion of one Hiſtory with another, which is very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the imagination of a <hi>Rabbin</hi> who fancied what he pleaſed, and fathered it upon <hi>Moſes.</hi> 2. We find Explications in theſe later <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums</hi> different from the former ones yet added to the former with an impudence not to be endured, and this in ſeveral places. 3. We there find long Narrations, which have no other foundation, than their method of explaining Scripture by the way of <hi>Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikon,</hi> (as they call it) as where we read of the five Sins of <hi>Eſau</hi> which he committed on the ſame day in which he ſold his birthright to <hi>Jacob;</hi> and in purſuance of their manner of explaining Scripture by <hi>Gematria,</hi> of which <hi>Rittangel</hi> on <hi>Jetzira</hi> has given ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>p.</hi> 31, 32, 33.</p>
               <p>But all this makes nothing againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thoſe places in the Paraphraſe,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93550:60"/> where they do little more than render the Text out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>Chaldee.</hi> In them there was no occaſion to ſhew any more than the ſenſe of the words, ſuch as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſts had received by Tradition from their Forefathers. Whereas the Authors of thoſe Additions thereby made a ſhew of Learning out of the common road, and gave themſelves the pleaſure to ſee their own fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions come into ſuch credit, that they were received as the Oracles of God. But beyond that, we muſt take notice, that, as on one hand thoſe <hi>Targums</hi> have been enlarged by ſo many Additions, ſo on the other hand they have been altered in many places, and new Ideas ſubſtituted to the old. To ſhew the alteration which was made in thoſe <hi>Targums</hi> by Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> we can remark a thing which hath been often taken notice of by <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> in his Lexicon <hi>Talmud, viz.</hi> that there are many places cited from thoſe <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums</hi> 500 years ago by the Author of <hi>Aroule;</hi> that are not to be found in them as they are now in Print. So we can prove clearly that new Ideas have been put in inſtead of the old, chiefly upon the points controverted between <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians. For in many places where St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Comments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prophets brings the common explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews</hi> as agreeing with the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſtians, we find the <hi>Targum</hi> brings an explication quite different from what it was to be according to St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>It appears by this the <hi>Jews</hi> have done in their Books the ſame thing which Papiſts
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93550:61"/> have done in the Books of the Fathers. They have added many things to help their Cauſe, and they have cut out many places which might have done great ſervice to Truth.</p>
               <p>As for the Additions then I will ſcarce cite any of them, but when it is evident that they ſpeak the ſenſe of the Ancients; and truly whatever one may ſay of the Corruptions of theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paraphraſes, I will maintain that it is as eaſie for an attentive Reader to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe Corruptions from the ancient Text (which it ſeems <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> had a deſign to do in a particular Treatiſe) as it is for one that looks on an old Pot or Kettle to tell where the Tinker has been at work, and to diſtinguiſh his Clouts from the Original me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The ancient pieces have a ſort of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that makes them to be valued, and which, eaſily ſhews their antiquity. The Additions are the rambling fancies of bold Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which they deviſed in later times as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion required, and thruſt them upon the ancient Paraphraſts who lived in thoſe times when there was no ſuch occaſion, nor could they foreſee that there would be any ſuch in after-times.</p>
               <p>As for example, we do not find that the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt's time ever ſpoke of two <hi>Meſſias;</hi> the one the Son of <hi>David,</hi> who was to reign gloriouſly; the other a ſuffering <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> The reaſon is plain, for they had no occaſion for that fancy of a ſuffering <hi>Meſſias.</hi> That aroſe upon their Diſputes with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who proved that the Sufferings of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93550:61"/> Chriſt were no other than what the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to ſuffer according to the Prophecies of Scripture. At firſt the <hi>Jews</hi> tried other ways to avoid the force of theſe Prophecies, but when no other would do, they came to this, to deviſe another <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and to give him the Sufferings which the Scripture attributes to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Son of <hi>David.</hi>

               <p>In a word, all theſe Conceits, of which the greateſt part of theſe Additions do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, do ſo evidently demonſtrate their Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that when one is acquainted with a little of the Hiſtory of the World as well as that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is ſcarce poſſible that he ſhould take them for the Text of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> or of the ancient Paraphraſts. Beſides all this, in the Modern Paraphraſes themſelves we find very often theſe words, <hi>Another Targum,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>yet, Another Targum,</hi> which ſhews that the following words are not the ancient <hi>Targum,</hi> but are the Additions of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors, whom the Copyers of the Paraphraſts have joyned as a new light to the ancient.</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>Jews</hi>'s inſerting ſuch things into their Paraphraſes, has been out of fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Diſcoveries which appeared to them new; or whether they have found it turn to account, to inſert theſe Additions in the Body of their ancient Paraphraſes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to enhance the value of them; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thought, by publiſhing them under the Names of thoſe ancient Commentators whoſe Authority is ſo venerable, to wreſt from the Chriſtians all the advantages they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93550:62"/> might draw from any thing in their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes; the things that they added being oftentimes contrary to what the Ancients did teach; is a ſecret among the <hi>Jews;</hi> but a ſecret little worth, ſince the Providence of God has preſerved the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, and the Books of <hi>Philo,</hi> which can give us ſo much light into the knowledg of what is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and what is modern, in theſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes.</p>
               <p>I will add nothing upon this matter, but this, that we ſee in the moſt ancient Books of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as in the Books call'd <hi>Rabboth, Mechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> and in their old <hi>Midraſhim</hi> almoſt all compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before the 7th. Century, and in the <hi>Talmud</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the ſame Ideas, and the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which we meet in the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, and in <hi>Philo</hi>'s Writings. And thoſe Ideas have been conſtantly followed by the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the <hi>Jews,</hi> thoſe very Men who have their name from their conſtant ſticking to the old Tradition of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the Authors of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books did acknowledg a Plurality, and a Trinity in the Divine Nature.</head>
               <p>HAving finiſhed our General Reflexions on the Traditional Senſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which was receiv'd among the <hi>Jews</hi> before the time of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Books wherein we can find ſuch a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it is time we ſhould come to the chief matter we deſigned to treat of. The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt's time had any notion of a Trinity. For the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> would make us believe, that <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> having been formerly a <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> and then turning Chriſtian, was the firſt that invented this Doctrine, or rather adopted it out of the <hi>Platonick</hi> into the Chriſtian Divinity; and that neither the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nor the Chriſtian Church had ever before conceived any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Trinity, or of any Plurality in the Divine Eſſence.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of the Trinity ſuppoſes the Divine Eſſence to be common to three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, diſtinguiſhed from one another by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Properties. Theſe Perſons are called by St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 7. the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word, and the Spirit. <hi>There are Three</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that bear Witneſs in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit; and theſe Three are One.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:93550:63"/>
               <p>This Perſonal diſtinction ſuppoſes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to be the Son, nor the Holy Ghoſt, and that the Son is not the Father, nor the Holy Spirit; Revelation teaching that the Son is begotten of the Father, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, or from the Father by the Son. And this diſtinction is the foundation of their Order, and of their Operations.</p>
               <p>For although the Unity of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes it neceſſary that theſe three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould all co-operate in the Works of God <hi>ad extra,</hi> as we call them, nevertheleſs there being a certain order among the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and a diſtinction founded in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Properties, the Holy Scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth an Oeconomy in their Operations; ſo that one work <hi>ad extra</hi> is aſcribed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another to the Son, and a third to the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>But this diſtinction of Perſons, all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſame common Nature and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, hinders not their being equally the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Worſhip, which Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to pay to God.</p>
               <p>I touch this matter but very briefly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my buſineſs is only to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Jews</hi> had any notion of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And our Opinion is this, that though the Goſpel has propoſed that Doctrine more clearly and diſtinctly, yet there were in the Old Teſtament ſufficient notices of it, ſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt's time did draw from thence their Notions concerning it.</p>
               <p>On the contrary the <hi>Socinians</hi> maintain, that this Doctrine is not only alike foreign to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93550:63"/> the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, but that it was altogether unknown to the <hi>Jews</hi> before and after Chriſt, till <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> firſt brought it into the Church.</p>
               <p>In oppoſition to which, I affirm for truth, 1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt, had a notion of a Plurality in God, following here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certain Traces of this Doctrine that are to be found in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ſame <hi>Jews</hi> following the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Teſtament did acknowledg a Trinity in the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>I begin the Examination of this Subject by conſidering the Notions of the Authors of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books. Now one cannot expect that theſe Authors ſhould have explained their mind with relation to the notions of a Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and of a Trinity in the Godhead, as if they had been Interpreters of the Books of the Old Teſtament. But they expreſs it ſufficiently without that, and ſpeak in ſuch a manner, that no body can deny that they muſt have had thoſe very Notions, when it appears that their Expreſſions in ſpeaking of God, ſuppoſes the Notions of a Plurality in the Godhead, and of a Trinity in particular. Let us conſider ſome of thoſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were ſo full of the notion of a Plurality, which is expreſſed in <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. that the Author of <hi>Tobith</hi> hath uſed it as the Form of Marriage among the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, <hi>Let us make unto him an aid.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Thou madeſt Man, and gaveſt him Eve his Wife for an helper and ſtay; of them came Mankind: Thou
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93550:64"/> haſt ſaid, It is not good that Man ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; Let us make unto him an aid like unto himſelf;</hi> whereas in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is only, <hi>I ſhall make.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly. We ſee that they acknowledg the Creation of the World by the Word of God, and by the Holy Ghoſt; as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. So the Book of <hi>Wiſdom, Ch.</hi> ix. 1. <hi>O God of my Fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hath made all things with thy Word,</hi> or more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>by thy Word,</hi> as it is explained in the 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 4. he asketh Wiſdom in theſe words, <hi>Give me Wiſdom that ſitteth by thy Throne.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Thy counſel who hath known? except thou give Wiſdom, and ſend thy Holy Spirit from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi> Where he diſtinguiſheth the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Wiſdom, and the Holy Spirit, from God, to whom he directs his Prayer. And ſo the Book of <hi>Judith, ch.</hi> xvi. 13, 14. <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord a new Song. O Lord, thou art great and glorious, wonderful in ſtrength, and invincible. Let all creatures ſerve thee, for thou ſpeakeſt, and they were made, thou didſt ſend forth thy Spirit, and it created them, and there is none that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt thy voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. They ſpeak of the Emanation of the Word from God: Thoſe are the words of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom, ch.</hi> vii. 25. <hi>For ſhe is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty; therefore can no defiled thing fall into her.</hi> That deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wiſdom deſerves to be conſidered, as we have it in the ſame place, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>For Wiſdom which is the worker of All things, taught me; for in her is an underſtanding ſpirit, holy, one only, manifold, ſubtil, lively, clear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93550:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> plain, not ſubject to hurt, loving the thing that is good, quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good. Kind to man, ſtedfaſt, ſure, free from care, having all power, over-ſeeing all things, and going through all underſtanding, pure, and moſt ſubtil Spirits; For Wiſdom is more moving than any motion; ſhe paſſeth and goeth through all things, by reaſon of her pureneſs. For ſhe is the brightneſs of the everlaſting Light, the unſpotted mirrour of the power of God, and the image of his Goodneſs.</hi> And indeed St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> i. 3. hath borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence what we read touching the Son, that he is the brightneſs of God's glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon. So the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaith, <hi>ch.</hi> xxv. 3. <hi>That it is come out of the mouth of the moſt High.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. There are ſeveral Names in Scripture which ſerve to expreſs the ſecond Perſon, the Son, the Word, the Wiſdom, the Angel of the Lord, but who is the Lord indeed. Now thoſe Authors uſe all theſe Names to expreſs a ſecond Perſon.</p>
               <p>For they acknowledge a Father; and a Son, by a natural conſequence: Thus the Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, ch.</hi> li. 10. <hi>I called upon the Lord the father of my Lord,</hi> in the ſame way as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Meſſias, Pſal.</hi> ii. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. and as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Proverbs, ch.</hi> viii. 25. as of a Son in the boſom of his Father, and <hi>ch.</hi> xxx. 4. <hi>What is his Sons name, if thou canſt tell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſpeak of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as the Creator of all things, ſo the Author of <hi>Wiſdom, ch.</hi> ix. 1. <hi>O God of my Fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hath made all things with thy word.</hi> Or more properly <hi>by thy Word.</hi> And ſo they call that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93550:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> Wiſdom <hi>the Worker of all things,</hi> Wiſd. <hi>ch.</hi> vli. 22.</p>
               <p>They ſpeak of the Wiſdom in the ſame words as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth, <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. and <hi>ch.</hi> viii. 22. where he expreſſeth the true notion of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And indeed they attribute to her, to have been eternal, <hi>Eccluſ. ch.</hi> iv. 18.</p>
               <p>They refer conſtantly to God himſelf, that is, to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of God, as we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhew at large, what is attributed to the Angel of the Lord in many places of the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to have delivered the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the Red Sea, ſo <hi>Wiſd. ch.</hi> xix. 9. <hi>They went at large like horſes, and leaped like lambs, praiſing thee, O Lord, who hadſt deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</hi> Again, to have had his Throne in a cloudy Pillar, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> xxiv. 4. To have been cauſed by the Creator of all things to reſt and to have his dwelling in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to have his inheritance in <hi>Iſrael, Ibid. v.</hi> 8. and ſo to have given his memorial to his Children, which is the Law commanded for an heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage into the Congregation of <hi>Jews, Ib.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>So they attribute to him to have ſpoken with <hi>Moſes, Eccluſ. ch.</hi> xlv. 5. <hi>He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the dark cloud, and gave him commandments before his face, even the Law of life and knowledg, that he might teach Jacob his Covenants, and Iſrael his Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, to come down from Heaven to fight againſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Wiſd. <hi>ch.</hi> xviii. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Thine Almighty Word leapt down from Heaven, out of thy Royal Throne, as a fierce man of war into the midſt of a land of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And brought thine unfeigned Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93550:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>as a ſharp ſword,</hi> and ſtanding up filled all things with <hi>death,</hi> and it touched the Heaven, but it ſtood upon the <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So they maintain that the Angel who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Joſhuah, ch.</hi> 5. was the Lord himſelf, ſo the Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, ch.</hi> xlvi. 5, 6. <hi>He call'd upon the moſt high Lord when the enemies preſſed upon him on every ſide, and the great Lord heard him. And with hailſtones of mighty power he made the battle to fall violently upon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the deſcent</hi> [of Bethoron] <hi>he deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that reſiſted, that the Nations might know all their ſtrength, becauſe he fought in the ſight of the Lord, and he followed the mighty one.</hi> They refer the Miracles wrought by <hi>Elias</hi> to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as you ſee in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, ch.</hi> xlviii. 3, 4, 5. <hi>By the Word of the Lord he ſhut up the Heaven, and alſo three times brought down fire. O Elias, how waſt thou honoured in thy wondrous deeds! and who may glory like unto thee! Who didſt raiſe up a dead man from death, and his ſoul from the place of the dead by the Word of the moſt High.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As there is nothing more common in the Old Teſtament than to call the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord, becauſe the Father ſent him to do all things under the Old Diſpenſation, ſo one can ſee that there is nothing more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in the Apocryphal Books, than to ſpeak of an Angel in particular, to whom is attributed all things, which could not be performed, but by God.</p>
               <p>Three things prove clearly that they did not conceive a created Angel, but an Angel who is God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93550:66"/>1. Becauſe they have this Maxim, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conſtant Divinity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> built upon Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 9. that God did take <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his Portion among all the Nations of the World, as if he had left other Nations to the conduct of Angels; ſo <hi>Eſth. ch.</hi> xiii. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Becauſe they refer to the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſome Hiſtories of the Old Teſtament, which the <hi>Jews</hi> till this day refer to an Uncreated An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or to the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>Shekina</hi> or <hi>Memra da Jehova,</hi> as I ſhall prove afterwards. We ſee that <hi>Wiſd. ch.</hi> xvi. 12. <hi>For it was neither herb, nor mollifying Plaiſter that reſtored them to health, but thy Word, O Lord, which healeth all things.</hi> So <hi>Wiſd. ch.</hi> xviii. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Thine Almighty Word leapt down from Heaven, out of thy Royal Throne, as a fierce man of war, into the midſt of a land of deſtruction, and brought thine unfeigned commandment as a ſharp ſword, and ſtanding up filled all things with death, and it touched the Heaven, but it ſtood upon the earth.</hi> I thought fit to repeat this place here, to make Mr. <hi>N.</hi> aſhamed, who hath expoſed thoſe Ideas, and laught at them, which I believe he would not have done if he had reflected upon two things; one is, That this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> who is ſpoken of, is that very <hi>man of war</hi> mentioned in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Canticle, <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 3. and in <hi>Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lith, ch.</hi> ix. 7. The other is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath followed the Notions of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſpeaking of a ſharp ſword, which is to be underſtood not of the Goſpel, but of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 12. But Mr. <hi>N.</hi> was in the right to laugh at ſuch an authority, which deſtroys to the ground the <hi>Unitarians</hi> Principles; for nothing can be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93550:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> more clear, than that this Author ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges a Plurality in God; that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> muſt be a Perſon, and a Perſon equal to the Father, being ſet upon the Royal Throne.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Becauſe they bring ſuch appearances of that Angel, which ſhew they conceived him as the God who ruled <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and who had taken their Temple for the place of his abode. And on the contrary, they ſpeak of God, whom they conſidered as dwelling in the Temple, in the ſame words which are uſed in Scripture, when it is ſpoken of the <hi>name of God, Exod.</hi> xxiii. 21. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> viii. 16. of the <hi>Angel of the Covenant, Malach.</hi> iii. 1. and ſuch expreſſions. So you ſee in the 1. Book of <hi>Eſdras, ch.</hi> ii. 5, 7. <hi>If therefore there be any of you that are of his people, let the Lord even his Lord be with him, and let him go up to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem that is in Judea, and build the Houſe of the Lord of Iſrael; for he is the Lord that dwelleth in Jeruſalem.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> iv. <hi>v.</hi> 58. <hi>Now when this young man was gone forth he lifted up his face to Heaven, toward Jeruſalem, and praiſed the King of Heaven.</hi> And <hi>Judith</hi> ch. v. 18. and <hi>ch.</hi> ix. 8. and 2 <hi>Macch.</hi> i. 25. <hi>The only giver of all things, the only juſt, Almighty and Everlaſting, thou that deliveredſt Iſrael from all trouble, and didſt chuſe the fathers, and ſanctifie them.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> ii. 17. <hi>We hope alſo that the God that delivered all his people, and gave them all on heritage, and the Kingdom, and the Prieſthood, and the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> xiv. 35. <hi>Thou, O Lord, of all things, who haſt need of nothing, was pleaſed that the Temple of thine habitation ſhould be among us.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:93550:67"/>
               <p>I can add 4ly, that they diſtinguiſh exactly the Angel of God from the Prophets, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are call'd by the ſame name of Angels or Meſſengers, and they diſtinguiſh him from Angels, which as creatures they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort to praiſe God, as in the Song of <hi>Azaria, v.</hi> 36. <hi>O ye Angels of the Lord, bleſs ye the Lord, praiſe and exalt him above all for ever.</hi> Such a diſtinction appears in the 1. of <hi>Eſdras, ch.</hi> i. 50, 51. Nevertheleſs, the God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſent by his Meſſenger to call them back, becauſe he ſpared them and his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle alſo. But they had his Meſſengers in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion; and look when the Lord ſpake unto them, they made a ſport of his Prophets. So in <hi>Tobith, ch.</hi> v. 16. <hi>So they were well pleaſed. Then ſaid he to Tobias, prepare thy ſelf for the journey, his father ſaid, Go thou with this man, and God which dwelleth in heaven, proſper your journey; and the Angel of God keep you company.</hi> Juſt according to the Prayer of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 48.16. <hi>The Angel which redeemed me from all evil bleſs the lads.</hi> And that very Angel is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God by <hi>Jacob</hi> in the verſe before. So in <hi>Eccluſ. ch.</hi> xvli. 17. <hi>For in the diviſion of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the whole earth, he ſet a ruler over every people, but Iſrael is the Lord's portion.</hi> So in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jeremy, v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>But ſay ye in your hearts, O Lord, we muſt worſhip thee.

               <p>To ſhew that the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt had ſuch a notion of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> who was to ſave his people, we muſt take notice of two things: the firſt is, that the Author of the three Books of <hi>Maccabees</hi> ſpeaks of God at the end of his Book in the ſame terms which are uſed by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> xlviii. 15, 16. and are to be referred to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not to a created Angel, as I have explained it in a particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of that very place of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters of Scripture have uſed ſuch method in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating ſome places of the Prophets, which ſheweth they underſtood that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be the very Angel of the Lord who is called the Counſellor, and that the Angel of the Lord was the Lord himſelf. Two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will ſhew that clearly; the firſt is in that famous Oracle of <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> ix. 6. they have theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Angel of the Great Counſel, whereas in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is ſaid, he ſhall be called the admirable <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The other example is in this other famous place of <hi>Iſai.</hi> lxiii. 9. they have tranſlated <hi>neither an Angel, but himſelf ſaved them;</hi> as if they had read <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93550:68"/> intangled in explaining that place, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that theſe Interpreters of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> look'd upon <hi>the face of God</hi> to have been God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which is the reaſon of their tranſlation, and ſhews that they underſtood <hi>the face of the Lord,</hi> which is ſo often ſpoken of by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which is <hi>Jehovah.</hi> I can add a reflection upon their Verſion of the 3d of <hi>Daniel, v.</hi> 25. <hi>Species quarti ſimilis filio Dei,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Aquila</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> who lived under <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> but the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> had tranſlated it <hi>ſimilis Angelo Dei,</hi> as ſaith an old <hi>Scholion,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Druſius</hi> in <hi>Fragmentis, p.</hi> 1213. which ſhews that the ancient <hi>Helleniſt</hi> had the ſame Notion of the Angel of God as of the Son of God. But all thoſe things ſhall be more cleared, when we come to the authority of the other <hi>Jews,</hi> which we are to produce.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps may think that the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſuppoſeth the Wiſdom which we maintain to be eternal, to have been created; and ſo ſaith that Author, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and <hi>ch.</hi> xxiv. 9. But I take notice of three things, 1. That ſuch an Objection may be good in the mouth of an <hi>Arian,</hi> but not at all in the mouth of a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and much leſs in the mouth of an <hi>Unitarian</hi> of this Kingdom, after their Writers have owned that the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or Word of God ſignifies the eſſential vertue of God. 2ly, That the Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> follows in that expreſſion the very words of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of <hi>Proverbs, ch.</hi> viii. 22. in which it anſwers to the word <hi>poſſeſſed,</hi> which is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 3ly, That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, although we ſhould ſuppoſe it to be the true reading, hath a very large ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93550:68"/> and indeed <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> who lived about the ſame age of the Authors of thoſe Apocryphal Books, and whoſe words are quoted by <hi>Euſebius de Praep. Ev. L.</hi> vii. §. 14. <hi>p.</hi> 324. declares that the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of in the Book of <hi>Proverbs</hi> was before the Heaven and Earth, and the very Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> calls it poſitively <hi>eternal, ch.</hi> xxiv. 18.</p>
               <p>There is another Objection which is back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the authority of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Wiſdom, underſtands a created Angel, but I ſhall ſhew afterwards the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of that opinion of <hi>Grotius;</hi> and his error is ſo plain that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and the <hi>Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Authors have been aſhamed to follow his authority in this point, daring not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the firſt of St. <hi>John</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified an Angel, which they would have done, if they could have digeſted the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Notions upon that place of <hi>Wiſdom, ch.</hi> xviii. 15.</p>
               <p>As for the Holy Ghoſt, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him for a Perſon, and for a Divine one, there is as much evidence from the ſame Apocryphal Books.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have noted they attributed to him the Creation of the World, as you ſee in <hi>Judith, ch.</hi> xvi. 14. <hi>Thou didſt ſend forth thy Spirit and it created them;</hi> which is an imitation of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Notions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. They call him the mouth of the Lord; ſo in the 3d Book of <hi>Eſdras, ch.</hi> i. 28. and 47, and 57. <hi>Howbeit Joſias did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the Prophet Jeremy,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93550:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpoken by the mouth of the Lord.</hi> And 47. <hi>And he did evil alſo in the ſight of the Lord, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for the words that were ſpoken unto him by the Prophet Jeremy from the mouth of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. They ſpeak of the <hi>Bina,</hi> or <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> by which is to be underſtood the Holy Spirit, from <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. and viii. So in <hi>Eccleſ. c.</hi> i. 4. <hi>Wiſdom hath been created before all things, and the underſtanding of prudence from everlaſting.</hi> So the Book of <hi>Wiſdom, chap.</hi> i. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>For into a malicious ſoul wiſdom ſhall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto ſin. For the Holy Spirit of diſcipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without underſtanding, and will not abide, when unrighteouſneſs cometh in. For Wiſdom is a loving ſpirit, and will not acquit a blaſphemer of his words; for God is witneſs of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue. For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world, and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4ly. They acknowledg him as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of God which knew all his Counſels. So you read in the Book of <hi>Wiſdom, ch.</hi> ix. 17. <hi>And thy counſel who hath known, except thou give wiſdom, and ſend thy Holy Spirit from above?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5ly. They ſpeak of him as of he that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the ſecrets of God; ſo <hi>Eccluſ. ch.</hi> 39.8. <hi>He ſhall ſhew forth that which he hath learned and ſhall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> 48.24, 25. He ſaith of <hi>Iſaiah, He ſaw by an excellent ſpirit what ſhould come to paſs at the laſt, and he comforted them that mourned in Sion. He ſhewed what ſhould come to paſs for ever, and ſecret things or ever they came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:93550:69"/>6ly. They acknowledg him to be ſent from God, <hi>Wiſdom, ch.</hi> ix. 17. <hi>And thy counſel who hath known, except thou give wiſdom, and ſend thy Holy Spirit from above?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all, if we conſider what Notions they had of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> which was promiſed to them, we ſhall find that they had much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Ideas than thoſe which are now enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the laſt <hi>Jews,</hi> and more like to them which we find among the Prophets.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is clear that they lookt upon him as the Perſon which was to ſit upon the Throne of God; the Title of <hi>my Lord</hi> which is given by the Author of <hi>Eccluſ. ch.</hi> li. 10. ſhews that beyond exception by ſo clear an alluſion to the <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. and ii. which both ſpeak of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly. They did not look upon it as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thing to ſuppoſe that God is to appear in the earth, as you ſee in <hi>Baruch, ch.</hi> iii. 37. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward did he ſhew himſelf upon earth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with men.</hi> For they refer that either to his appearance upon <hi>Sinai,</hi> or to the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. They ſuppoſe another coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and then <hi>the Saints are to judge the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord ſhall reign for ever.</hi> Wiſd. <hi>ch.</hi> iii. 8. which words have been borrowed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. They acknowledg ſuch Appearances of God, as we have an example in 2 <hi>Macc. ch.</hi> xi. 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> xxi. 22, 23. <hi>Now when they that were with Maccabeus heard that he beſieged the holds, they and all the people with lamentation and tears beſought the Lord that he would ſend a good Angel to deliver Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:93550:70"/>5ly. They ſpeak of the Appearances of God as an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the very word uſed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> for the firſt and ſecond Appearance of Jeſus Chriſt. So the 2. of <hi>Macc. ch.</hi> xv. 27. and 34. <hi>So every man praiſed toward the even that glorious Lord, ſaying, Bleſſed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled. So that fighting with their hands, and praying unto God with their hearts, they ſlew no leſs than thirty and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; for through the appearance of God they were greatly cheared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6ly. They expected at the ſecond coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſuch a manifeſtation of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as in the Conſecration of the Temple. So 2 <hi>Macc. ch.</hi> ii. 8. <hi>Then ſhall the Lord ſhew them theſe things, and the glory of the Lord ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and the cloud alſo as it was ſhewed under Moſes, and as when Solomon deſired that the place might be honourably ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe theſe Proofs are ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, 1. That there was before Jeſus Chriſt's time a Notion of Plurality in the Godhead. 2ly, That they believed that ſuch a Plurality was a Trinity. 3ly, That they look'd upon the Son or the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Holy Ghoſt, as not created Beings, but as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſame Divine Nature with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by an Eternal Emanation from him, as having the ſame Power, and the ſame Majeſty.</p>
               <p>But theſe Ideas of the Apocryphal Books will appear more clear, when we take them in conjunction with the explication of the like Notions among other <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, which I ſhall now conſider more particularly. And withal thoſe places of Scripture on which they ground their Explications.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the <hi>Jews</hi> had good Grounds to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſome kind of Plurality in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</head>
               <p>AFter what I have quoted from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Apocryphal Books which are in the hand of all people, to prove, 1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt had a Notion of a Plurality in God, following herein certain Traces of this Doctrine that are to be found in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; And, 2ly, that the ſame <hi>Jews</hi> did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg a Trinity in the Divine Nature; I will proceed to conſider in particular the Grounds which they build upon to admit ſuch Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt of thoſe two Articles, which is, That the Stile of God in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Scriptures gave them a Notion of a Plurality in God. To eſtabliſh this Propoſition I do not intend to gather all the Texts of the Old Teſtament, which might be brought to prove a Plurality in the Divine Nature; nor will I anſwer the ſeveral Solutions which the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> have invented to darken this truth, which they oppoſe.</p>
               <p>It ſhall ſuffice me to do two things: 1. To ſhew that the Stile of God in Scripture, and of the Sacred Authors, leads one naturally to the Notion of a Plurality of Perſons in the Divine Eſſence. 2. That this Stile made the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93550:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> like Impreſſion on the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt, as was made by it anciently, and is ſtill made on it by the generality of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. So that the <hi>Jews</hi> generally have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Divine Nature, which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe perfectly one, is diſtinguiſhable into certain Properties, which we call Perſons.</p>
               <p>For the proof of the firſt Point, to wit, that the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Plurality in God; I make theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reflections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſes,</hi> the chief End of whoſe Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was to root out of the minds of Men the conceit of Polytheiſm, does yet deſcribe the Creation of the World in words that inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate a Plurality. <hi>In the beginning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Bara Elohim, the Gods created, Gen.</hi> i. 1. He might have ſaid, <hi>Jehovah Bara,</hi> Jehovah be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper name by which God made himſelf know to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him to his People, <hi>Ixod.</hi> iii. 15. or he might have ſaid, <hi>Eloah Bara,</hi> and ſo he had joyned the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Number of <hi>Elohim,</hi> which ſignifies God, with the Verb <hi>Bara,</hi> which is alſo the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Number, and ſignifies <hi>created.</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> uſes the Plural word <hi>Elohim</hi> with a Verb of the Singular Number, and he repeats it thirty times in the Hiſtory of the Creation only, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this word denotes a Plurality in the Divine Nature, and not one ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Moſes</hi> joyned always the Noun <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> which is Plural, with a Verb or Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in the Singular, we might have judged, that by calling God by a name in the Plural, he had followed the corrupt cuſtom which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93550:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> then obtained among the Heathens, of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gods in the Plural, and that he deſigned to rectifie it by expreſſing the ſingle action of God by a Singular Verb or Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
               <p>But here this Excuſe will not ſerve; for, 1. he had the word, <hi>Eloah,</hi> God, in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, which he uſes <hi>Deut. xxxii.</hi> 15, 17. and in other places: He had alſo ſeveral other Names of God, which he uſes in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all of them Singular, and conſequently any of them had been fitter for his uſe to root out Polytheiſm. 2. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſometimes joyns the Noun <hi>Elohim</hi> with Verbs and Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives in the Plural. There are ſeveral exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this in his Books, and more in the other Sacred Writers that imitated him in it, you may ſee it in <hi>Gen. xx.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; xxxv.</hi> 7. <hi>Job xxxv.</hi> 10. <hi>Joſ. xxiv.</hi> 19. <hi>Pſal. cxlix.</hi> 1. <hi>Eccleſ. xii.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Sam. vii.</hi> 23. <hi>Eſ. liv.</hi> 5. which ſhews the impudence of <hi>Abarbanel,</hi> who to elude the force of this Argument, maintains that the word <hi>Elohim</hi> is a Singular. In <hi>Pent. fol.</hi> 6. <hi>col.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another Reflection on the Stile of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which ought to be every where Singular, and yet intimates a Plurality, is this, That <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the Hiſtory of the Creation brings in God ſpeaking to ſome one, thus, <hi>Let ſuch a thing be made,</hi> and it follows, <hi>it was made;</hi> and again, <hi>God ſaid</hi> — and — <hi>God ſaid</hi> — This expreſſion is repeated no leſs than eight times within the compaſs of one Chapter, which is a thing very ſurprizing in ſo conciſe an Hiſtory. For to whom did God then ſpeak? to whom did he iſſue out his Orders? or who
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93550:72" rendition="simple:additions"/> was he that did execute them? There were then neither Men nor Angels to obey him, nor to hear him ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is no one that reads the account of Man's Creation, but, if he conſiders what he reads, is ſtruck with theſe words of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. <hi>Let Us make man after our Image and likeneſs.</hi> Theſe words in the Plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber denote plainly a Plurality. <hi>Let US make,</hi> and <hi>OUR Image,</hi> are too lively Characters of Plurality to be paſſed over without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular regard.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may make the ſame reflection on thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 5. which point out a Plurality of Perſons, <hi>And you ſhall be as Gods;</hi> and a little after, <hi>Adam is become as one of Us? ver.</hi> 22. We find a like example, <hi>Gen.</hi> xi. 7. where God ſaith, <hi>Let Us go down and confound their Language.</hi> Again, <hi>Gen.</hi> xx. 13. <hi>When God cauſed me to wander from my Father's houſe;</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, when the <hi>Gods</hi> cauſed me to wander.

               <p>All this is contained within one Book on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> We meet with the ſame Notion in theſe words of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> ch. iv. 7. <hi>Who have the Gods ſo nigh unto them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may trace the Idea of Plurality ſtill further in the following Books; as in <hi>Joſhua, xxiv.</hi> 19. <hi>And Joſhua ſaid, You cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is an holy God</hi>—where in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> it is, the <hi>Holy Gods.</hi> So <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. <hi>xxx.</hi> 3. <hi>I neither learned wiſdom, nor have the knowledg of the Holies,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Holy.</hi> And <hi>Eccl. xii.</hi> 1. <hi>Remember thy Creators.</hi>

               <p>Upon the whole we ſhould remark, 1. That this Plurality is expreſſed in ſeveral paſſages of the Old Teſtament, and not in one place only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is no kind of ſpeaking, by which a Plurality in God may be ſignified but is uſed in the Old Teſtament.

                  </gap> the Living Gods, and from which he draws an argument for the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That though there is but one only <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> yet in the Holy Scripture we meet with ſeveral <hi>Elohim</hi> to whom the Title of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> is given; this we ſee in a hundred pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Law, where the words are <hi>Jehovah Eloheka,</hi> i. e. the Lord thy Gods, which does certainly deſerve to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>This alſo we more particularly ſee in the Hiſtory of the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 30.24. where it is written, <hi>That Jehovah rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimſtone and fire from Jehovah out of Heaven.</hi> There is Jehovah, and Jehovah; and if they do not make two, I know not what will expreſs a Plurality. But we ſhall have more to ſay of this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>I have given in ſhort ſome Marks of a Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in the Divine Nature, which may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Writings of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For the fuller ſatisfaction of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I am next to ſhew that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> made the ſame Reflections, and formed the ſame Notions that we have of the Divine Nature. To do this with the more clearneſs, I ſhall obſerve this Method: 1. To ſhew what were their Reflections on the Unity of the Divine Nature. 2. To ſhew what their Reflections were on thoſe paſſages of the Scripture which note a Plurality in the Unity of the Divine Eſſence.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, <hi>Philo,</hi> who left a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pieces behind him, is beſt able to inſtruct
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93550:73"/> us; and he aſſerts that the Nature of God is incomprehenſible, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we cannot form a juſt Idea of it. <hi>Alleg.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 43. <hi>F. G. De Profug. p.</hi> 370. <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That God's Providence and Exiſtence are known to us; but as to his Eſſence, we are altogether ignorant of it. <hi>De Mund. p.</hi> 889. <hi>D.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having in ſeveral places of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings obſerved, 1. That <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver of the <hi>Jews,</hi> made this his chief End to deſtroy the Notion of <hi>Polytheiſm.</hi> He then, 2. Affirms, that though it is ſaid, <hi>God is one;</hi> yet this is not to be underſtood with reſpect to Number. <hi>Alleg. L. III. p.</hi> 841. Not that <hi>Philo</hi> would have it thought that there is more than one God, but hereby he intimates the Unity of God to be tranſcendent, to have nothing common with that of other Beings which fall under Number.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And indeed he acknowledges a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in God. If you ask him what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, he will tell you—</p>
               <p n="4">4. That God begets his Word. Who is therefore ſaid to be not unbegotten like God, and yet not begotten like his Creatures? <hi>Quis rerum Divin. haereſ. p.</hi> 398. <hi>A.</hi> And on account of this Generation, he calls him the Firſt-born of God. <hi>De Agricult. p.</hi> 152. <hi>De Confuſ. Ling. p.</hi> 267.</p>
               <p>Again, he will tell you, that God begets his Wiſdom, <hi>De Temul. p.</hi> 190. <hi>E.</hi> And that his Wiſdom is the ſame with his Word. <hi>Alleg.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 39. <hi>F.</hi> following, no doubt, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 22. But did he own that this Generation was made in time?</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:93550:74"/>
               <p>No: For, 5. He aſſerts, that this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was from all Eternity; For he ſaith, the Word of God is the Eternal Son of God. <hi>De Confuſ. Ling. p.</hi> 255. <hi>D. p.</hi> 267. <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. When he would explain, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, or for what reaſon God is called in Scripture, <hi>The God of Gods;</hi> he ſaith not, that it is in reſpect of the Angels, whoſe God he is, and who ſometimes are called <hi>Elohim,</hi> or <hi>Gods,</hi> even by <hi>Philo</hi> himſelf. <hi>De Opif. p.</hi> 4. <hi>F.</hi> But he ſaith it is in relation to his two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Lib. de Victim. off. p.</hi> 661. <hi>G.</hi> which would be a ridiculous thing, had he thought theſe two Powers were no other than two Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Philo</hi> is ſo far from thinking them meer ſimple Attributes, that he maintains, 1. That theſe Powers made the World, or by them God created the World. <hi>De Victim. off. p.</hi> 663. <hi>F. de Confuſ. Ling. p.</hi> 270. <hi>B. de Plant. Noae. p.</hi> 176. <hi>E. Quis rer. div. Haer. p.</hi> 393. <hi>G.</hi> 2. That theſe eternal Powers appeared, acted, and ſpoke as real Perſons, and in a viſible and ſenſible manner. <hi>Lib. de Cherub. p.</hi> 97. <hi>D. De Sacr. Ab. p.</hi> 108. <hi>B. C. Quod Deus ſit immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab. p.</hi> 229. <hi>B. p.</hi> 241. <hi>C. D. p.</hi> 242. <hi>B. de Plant. Noae. p.</hi> 176. <hi>D. E. Quod rer. div. haer. p.</hi> 393. <hi>G. De Somn. p.</hi> 457. <hi>G. de Mund. p.</hi> 888. <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He alſo maintains, that the two Cherubins which were over the Ark, were the Symbols of the two eternal Powers of God. <hi>De Vit. Moſ. III. p.</hi> 517. <hi>F. Quis rerum Divin. Haer. p.</hi> 393. <hi>G.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are in general, the Notions which the <hi>Jews</hi> had of a Plurality in the Divine Eſſence, which is otherwiſe ſingle and one.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93550:74"/> I ſhall hereafter ſhew, that the very ſame No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſpred throughout the ancient <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums,</hi> as far as the Nature of the Works, which for the moſt part are only naked Tranſlations of the Hebrew into Chaldee, does give occaſion to the Authors of theſe <hi>Targums</hi> to explain themſelves on theſe Heads.</p>
               <p>Now let us go on to examine the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on which the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> grounded this Notion of a Plurality in God: For it is not to be imagined that they would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved thus without ſome Authority for it in the Books of the Old Teſtament, upon which alone they pretended to found the Doctrines of their Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly then, As to the firſt Words of <hi>Moſes. In the beginning the Gods created:</hi> I muſt own that <hi>Philo,</hi> writing in Greek, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Notion of Plurality in expounding this Text: For he followed the Verſion of the LXX, which reads <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Singular, inſtead of the Hebrew <hi>Elohim</hi> in the Plural. But then he more than hints that this Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was common among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeeing that he rarely ſpeaks of God without mentioning his two Powers, as I have newly obſerved to you. And in one place he gives this reaſon why the Name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed throughout the Hiſtory of the Creation; becauſe that was the Appellation of one of God's Powers by which he made the World: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>de Plant. Noae. p.</hi> 176. <hi>D. E.</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:93550:75"/> Which ſhews evidently, that the Notion of Plurality did ſtill remain among the Greek <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Plural <hi>Elohim,</hi> which was the Ground of it, was taken away by their Tranſlators, for a reaſon that I ſhall ſhortly mention.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew that the word <hi>Elohim</hi> in the Plural has always made this impreſſion on the Minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> we muſt obſerve, 1. That long before <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s time, there was a ſort of Men who imagined that the Angels did create the World, grounding it upon this place, compared with thoſe other Texts where the Angels are ſometimes called <hi>Elohim,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> viii. 6. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> xcvii. 7. Such was the Opinion of <hi>Menander,</hi> the Scholar of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> themſelves were ſo perſwaded of a Plurality expreſſed in the word <hi>Elohim,</hi> as to teach in Title <hi>Megilla, c.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 11. That the LXX Interpreters did purpoſely change the Notion of Plurality, couched in the Hebrew Plural, into a Greek Singular; as they did alſo on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. and xi. 7. leſt <hi>Ptolom. Philadelph.</hi> ſhould conclude, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as himſelf, had a belief of <hi>Polytheiſm.</hi> That was taken notice of by St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Preface to the Book <hi>De Quaeſt. Hebr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That however the Conſtruction of a Noun Plural, with a Verb Singular, may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it doubtful to ſome, whether theſe words expreſs a Plurality or no; yet certainly there can be no doubt in thoſe places, where a Verb or Adjective Plural are joyned with the word <hi>Elohim;</hi> and ſuch places, as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93550:75" rendition="simple:additions"/> have made appear, are often to be found in the Writings of the Old Teſtament. That the word <hi>Elohim</hi> is to be underſtood Plurally, this the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſince Chriſt's time, have acknowledged to be agreeable to their ſenſe of the word. For in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxviii. 13. where the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſee the Gods aſcending,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they conclude that there were two perſons that appeared to her, and ſo they think <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> to be the Perſons. <hi>Midraſh Sam. Rabbatha, cap.</hi> 27. <hi>&amp; Tanchuma fol.</hi> 63. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>It is natural for Chriſtians to conceive, that where it is ſaid ſo often, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. <hi>And God ſaid,</hi> there God ſpoke to his Word, by which St. <hi>John</hi> writes that all things were made, <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 3. <hi>Socinus</hi> will not have it that St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of the Word or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does mean it of the firſt Creation, but of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. His Diſciples here being convinced that this cannot be maintained, have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him in it, and do now agree in what he denied. But then they ſuppoſe the Word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more than the virtue and power of God; and therefore by this Phraſe, <hi>Let it be done,</hi> and <hi>it was ſo,</hi> no more is imported, than God's exciting of himſelf to do this or that thing, or that God ſaid to himſelf, Let ſuch a thing be done, and he did it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>But if this Evaſion can ſatisfie an <hi>Unitarian,</hi> as it eaſily may one that cannot maintain his opinion without it; yet it cannot ſatisfie an impartial Reader. For this we have the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ancient Synagogue, which looked
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93550:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> on the Word of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as a true Cauſe and Agent, to whom God ſpoke, and who by an infinite power wrought the ſeveral works of the ſix days.</p>
               <p>Now that this was the judgment of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Synagogue, and conſequently that they acknowledged a Plurality in God, will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any one that will be at the pains to conſult <hi>Philo</hi> and the ancient <hi>Targums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Philo,</hi> he hath drawn ſo full a Syſtem of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as to leave himſelf nothing more to add on that Subject. According to him, it is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in whom were repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the firſt Ideas of all things, and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſtampt the impreſſions of them on matter: Whence he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>De opif. p.</hi> 4. <hi>G. &amp; p.</hi> 24. <hi>C.</hi> It is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that created the World, as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew from ſeveral parts of his Works, in the following part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Targums,</hi> to cite all the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in them that confirm this truth, would be a trouble next to that of tranſcribing thoſe Books. I ſhall therefore collect only ſome of the principal places. <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlv. 12. declares his opinion, that the Word created the Earth; and again on <hi>Iſa</hi> xlviii. 13. Thus <hi>Onkelos</hi> aſſures, that the Heavens were made by the Word of the Lord, on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiii. 27. And he almoſt conſtantly diſtinguiſhes the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as another Perſon from the Father, of which I ſhall in the following Chapters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many proofs.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:93550:76"/>
               <p>Indeed in this Paraphraſe of the Hiſtory of the Creation, he uſes not the Word <hi>Memra,</hi> which in <hi>Chaldee</hi> anſwers to that of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Greek.</hi> Nor was there any need, ſince he uſed all along the Verb <hi>Amar,</hi> from whence comes the Noun <hi>Memra,</hi> and ſo interprets the Text word for word, which ſeems to be his chief deſign in this Paraphraſe.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt take notice of one thing which is of great moment in this Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> make a great difference between that word <hi>Vajomer,</hi> which is found in the Hiſtory of the Creation, and this word <hi>Vajedabber;</hi> the firſt having a natural and neceſſary relation to the <hi>Memra,</hi> and the laſt ſignifying no more than the ſpeech of God or of any Man. <hi>R. Menach. de Rekan. in Pent. fol.</hi> 124. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 152. <hi>col.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Onkelos</hi> does three things which are equivalent to it: the one is, that inſtead of <hi>Elohim,</hi> he uſes the word <hi>Jehova,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> read <hi>Adonai,</hi> becauſe it has the Vowels of the word <hi>Adonai;</hi> and both the word <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim,</hi> which is the Plural out of <hi>Regimen,</hi> ſo as God uſes it in ſpeaking of himſelf, <hi>Mal.</hi> i. 6. and the Vowels of the word <hi>Adonai</hi> in <hi>regimen,</hi> which they put under the Letters of <hi>Jehova,</hi> being alſo Plural, both theſe things do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a Plurality in God as much as the word <hi>Elohim</hi> did in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that he doth render the words, <hi>in the beginning,</hi> not by the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> word which anſwers to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but by another which ſignifies the firſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and not by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it is obſerved by all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers who make the ſame reflection
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93550:77"/> upon the Tranſlation of the Targum <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lami,</hi> in which we read not <hi>in the beginning,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>by the Wiſdom.</hi> As you ſee in a Comment upon the <hi>Targums,</hi> Printed at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> not long ago, where he follows thoſe Notions as the ancient and the common Doctrine of the Synagogue.</p>
               <p>The third is, that in the ſequel of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe, he uſes the word <hi>Memra,</hi> as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Perſon by whom God acts and ſpeaks in all his Appearances to Men.</p>
               <p>That theſe words, <hi>Let us make Man after our Image, &amp;c.</hi> have made a like impreſſion on the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> appears clearly from the pains they take to explain them. I am ſure <hi>Philo</hi> was convinced, that they note a Plurality, when he, writing on this Text, maintained that God had fellow-workers in the Creation of Man. <hi>De opif. p.</hi> 12. <hi>B. E.</hi> It is true he ſometimes advances that God ſpoke theſe words to the Angels, or to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and he has been followed herein by ſome <hi>Jews</hi> after Jeſus Chriſt, as we ſee in the Explication of them in <hi>Breſh. Rab.</hi> §. 8. and in <hi>Jalkut.</hi> §. 12, 13. wherein they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that God conſulted the Angels alſo in the Creation of the World; although accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Talmudical <hi>Jews</hi> the Angels were not created till the ſecond or the fifth day; and ſuch a conſultation between God and his Creatures is rejected with ſcorn by <hi>Abarbanel</hi> in <hi>Pental. Fol.</hi> 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>But it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Philo</hi>'s reaſon for this Expoſition, was to give the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Original of Sin, which after the manner of divers of the Philoſophers, with
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93550:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> whom he was much converſant, he ſearched for in the matter of which Man was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in reſpect of his Body, as may be ſeen in the place which I have now quoted.</p>
               <p>For in other places he maintains: 1. That God took his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Word, for his fellow-worker. <hi>De Opif. p.</hi> 24, <hi>&amp; p.</hi> 25. 2. That Man was created after the Image of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Word. <hi>De Plant. Noae. p.</hi> 199. <hi>D.</hi> But he ſaith nothing of the Image of Angels, or of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which yet he ought to have ſpoken of, had he writ coherently and ſuitably to that other Explication.</p>
               <p>I ſay it again, that in many of his Pieces he aſſerts, The <hi>Word</hi> made Man, and after the Image of the Word was Man created, which he ſhews very largely. <hi>Alleg.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 60. <hi>C. D. De Plant. Noae. p.</hi> 169.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He maintains, that God ſpake this to his Powers, as may be collected from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this Text. <hi>De Confuſ. Ling. p.</hi> 270. <hi>A. C.</hi> and as he ſaith expreſly, <hi>Lib. de Profug. p.</hi> 357. <hi>G.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> — That is, he ſhews that Man only was formed by God with fellow-workers; for <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us that God ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man after our Image,</hi> implying a Plurality in the expreſſion, <hi>Let Us make.</hi> God therefore ſpeaks here to his <hi>Powers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He expreſſes himſelf in ſo particular a manner on this head, as to leave no doubt concerning his opinion of this place. It is in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93550:78"/> his firſt Book of Queſtions and Solutions, which is now loſt, all but a fragment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by <hi>Euſeb. Praep. Evang.</hi> vii. 13. <hi>p.</hi> 322, 323. His words are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Why does God ſay in the Image of God made I Man, and not in his own Image, as if he had ſpoken of another God? This Scripture-expreſſion is for wiſe and good reaſons, for nothing mortal can be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned after the Image of the Supreme God and Father of all things, but of his Word or <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>To ſpeak next of the ancient <hi>Targums,</hi> they are not unacquainted with this Notion, which they ſhew as far as the nature of their Verſions would permit. God made Man by his Word, ſaith the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. and the ſame thing <hi>Jonathan</hi> teaches, <hi>Eſ.</hi> xlv. 12.</p>

               <p>I know that in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Targum on <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. God is brought in as ſpeaking to the Angels, when he ſaid, <hi>Let Us make Man.</hi> But he who reads this and the following verſe in the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and compares them with the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, will ſoon ſee that theſe are not the words of the ancient Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt, but an Addition made to them by the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince Chriſt's time. What I have ſaid above is a convincing proof of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> cannot avoid being ſhockt a little with the expreſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> xix. 24. <hi>The Lord—rained from the Lord out of Heaven.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93550:79"/> and thus it Paraphraſes the Text, <hi>The Jehova rained from before the face of the Jehova from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This Notion of Plurality muſt have ſunk deep into the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeeing they have conſtantly read the word <hi>Jehova,</hi> which is ſingular, with the Vowels of the word <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> which is Plural, inſtead of <hi>Adoni,</hi> which is Singular: And this notwithſtanding their diſpute with the Chriſtians, whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of Tritheiſm. I am not ignorant that this manner of reading <hi>Jehova</hi> was long in uſe before the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt. But this it is that renders my Remark the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For all the other names of God, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him by ſome one of his Attributes are Singular, as well as the name <hi>Jehova</hi> is Singular, which is the proper name of God; And yet the <hi>Jews</hi> all agree to forbear ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the name <hi>Jehova</hi> by any of his many Names that are Singular, but interpret it by that of <hi>Adonai,</hi> whoſe Plural Vowels make <hi>Jehova</hi> to ſignifie Plurally, as much as to ſay my Lords; and that for this reaſon, as it ſeems, becauſe there is more than one in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, to whom the name <hi>Jehova</hi> is given in Scripture.</p>
               <p>It is clear how ſenſible the <hi>Jews</hi> have been that there is a Notion of Plurality plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, ſince they have forbidden their common people the reading of the Hiſtory of the Creation, leſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it literally, it ſhould lead them into Hereſie. <hi>Malmon. Mor. Neboch. p.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 29. The <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> as I before noted, have invented this excuſe for the <hi>Seventy,</hi> as to their chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93550:79"/> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Plural, into a <hi>Greek</hi> Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; they ſay it was for fear <hi>Ptolomy Phil.</hi> ſhould take the <hi>Jews</hi> for Polytheiſts. And to this they have added another Story, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelf was ſtartled at God's ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>Let Us make Man,</hi> in which he thought a Plurality was expreſſed, and that he remonſtrated to God the danger which might ariſe thereby; and at length reſolved not to write them, till he had God's expreſs order for it, which God did give him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the danger that <hi>Moſes</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted might follow. <hi>Bereſh. Rab.</hi> §. 8.</p>
               <p>Another thing relating to this Head, which deſerves our conſideration, is this; That the <hi>Samaritans</hi> who were originally of the ſame Religion with the <hi>Jews,</hi> but receive only the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> have ſhewn that they had in the Apoſtles times the ſame Notions that are met with in <hi>Philo</hi> of a Plurality in God. We have a proof of it, <hi>Act.</hi> viii. 9. where we read that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched that people, giving out that himſelf was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſome great one; he did not ſay what, but gave them leave to underſtand it their own way. And how did they take it? This follows <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>They ſaid,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>this perſon is the great power of God.</hi> This they would not have ſaid, if they had not believed, that beſides the great God, there was alſo a perſon called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I ſay a Perſon, for I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>N.</hi> can't think they took <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Attribute.</p>
               <p>But looking yet nearer into this Text, I conceive it is plain, that they underſtood
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93550:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> there was more than one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for as it is in the Text, <hi>they ſaid this is the great</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſeems to imply that they believed there was another power leſs than this. It ſeems yet plainer in another reading of the Text, which I take to be the true reading, for we find it not only in the now vulgar <hi>Latin,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> i. 20. which ſheweth it was the current reading in his time, and we find it alſo in ſeveral Manuſcripts, ſome of which are of the higheſt eſteem with Learned Men, as namely, the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> in the King's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and the ancient Manuſcript of <hi>Lions</hi> in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Library: In all theſe the words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>This perſon is the power of God which is called the great power.</hi> For their calling him the power of God, what that means we cannot better learn than from <hi>Origen,</hi> who ſpeaking of <hi>Simon,</hi> and ſuch others as would make themſelves like our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith, they called themſelves, <hi>Sons of God,</hi> or the <hi>Power of God;</hi> which he makes to be two Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of one and the ſame ſignification. [<hi>Orig. cont. Celſum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 44.] And both theſe Titles are given to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by <hi>Philo</hi> in more places than we can number. For their calling him <hi>the Great Power of God,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that there was another power beſides; this alſo perfectly agrees with the Notions of <hi>Philo,</hi> who ſo often ſpeaks of the two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God, deſcribing them as true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſons.</p>
               <p>We have a farther proof of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> having theſe Notions, in the account which their Country-man <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> hath given
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93550:80"/> us of the honour they had for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in his time, which was about eighty years after the writing of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> It may ſeem very ſtrange that when the charms of that <hi>Magus,</hi> wherewith he had bewitched that poor people, were ſo intirely diſſolved by <hi>Philip</hi>'s Preaching and Miracles, that not only they but the Impoſtor himſelf had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Chriſtian Religion, yet after this he could ſo far bewitch them a ſecond time as to raiſe himſelf in their opinion from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great power of God, (as they called him before) to be, in their new ſtyle, the God above all power whatſoever. Yet that was the Title they gave him in <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s time, as he ſheweth in his Dialogue with <hi>Tryphon, [Juſtin. Dial. cum Tryph. p.</hi> 349. <hi>G.</hi>] elſwhere <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſaith [<hi>Apol.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 69. <hi>E.</hi>] of <hi>Simon,</hi> they confeſs him as the firſt God, and as ſuch they worſhip him. This Notion of a firſt God is manifeſtly the ſame with that of <hi>Philo,</hi> who called the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ſecond God. [<hi>Euſeb. Prep. Evang.</hi> vii. 13. <hi>p.</hi> 323.] But if the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in the Apoſtles time took <hi>Simon</hi> to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſecond God, as I have ſhewn it more than probable that they meant it by calling him the <hi>Great power of God,</hi> Who ſhould be the ſecond God now, ſince <hi>Simon</hi> was ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in their opinion, that now they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him to be the Firſt? <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſheweth in the place before mentioned [<hi>p.</hi> 69. <hi>E.</hi>] that in his time as they called <hi>Simon</hi> the firſt God, ſo they called his Companion <hi>Helen,</hi> the ſecond God. His words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, what is that? one may eaſily gueſs; for certainly the firſt emanation from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93550:81"/> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And ſo according to <hi>Juſtin</hi> himſelf, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies. For in the ſame Book he interprets it of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, [<hi>Apol.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 97. <hi>b.</hi>] So that as the ſecond God was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Philo</hi>'s account, ſo was <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Companion the ſame in the opinion of the <hi>Samaritans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This poor bewitched people were almoſt Singular in this opinion in <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s time; for he ſaith, then there were but few of their way in other Nations. And <hi>Origen</hi> who wrote within ſixty years after, ſaith, That when he wrote, there were of <hi>Simon</hi>'s Sect ſcarce thirty at <hi>Samaria,</hi> and none any where elſe in the World, [<hi>Orig. cont. Celſ.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 44.] Poſſibly there might remain ſome of them till thoſe times when other Writers give other accounts of their Opinions, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly their Opinions might vary, ſo that thoſe later accounts are not to be much heeded; we can't be certain of any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but what we have from <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who lived when they were at the higheſt, and writing as he did to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour an Apology for the Chriſtians, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with the Errors of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men at <hi>Samaria,</hi> which as he more than intimates was not without ſome hazard of his being torn in pieces by the Mobb, [<hi>Juſt. Dial. cum Tryphon. p.</hi> 340.] we may be very ſure he would write nothing of them, but what was ſo evidently true that it could not be denied by any that lived in thoſe days.</p>
               <p>But from the account that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> gives of them, together with what we read in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> I think it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93550:81"/> proved, that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> held a Plurality in the Divine Nature; which not a little confirms that which I undertook to prove of the <hi>Jews</hi> having theſe Notions in the times of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not inſiſt longer on the Arguments which confirm a Plurality in the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe I ſhall touch on ſome of them again in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe, where I ſhall ſhew that thoſe places of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that ſpeak of the Angel of the Lord, are to be underſtood not of a created Angel, but of a perſon that is truly <hi>Jehova;</hi> and that this has been acknowledged by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Jews;</hi> which alone is proof enough of this Notion's being ſufficiently known by that Nation, to which God committed his Sacred Oracles, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 6.</p>
               <p>Paſs we now to the ſecond Article, that the <hi>Jews</hi> did ſo acknowledg a Plurality in God, as that at the ſame time they held that this Plurality was a Trinity.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the <hi>Jews</hi> did acknowledge the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Belief of a Trinity in the Divine Nature; and that they had the Notion of it.</head>
               <p>IN purſuance of the Method laid down in the foregoing Chapter, I am now to ſhew theſe two things: 1. That there are in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament ſo many and ſo plain Intimations of a Trinity in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, as might very well move the <hi>Jews</hi> to take them for a ſufficient ground for the Belief of this Doctrine. 2. That theſe Intimations had that real effect on the <hi>Jews,</hi> that as they found in their Scriptures a Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in the One Infinite Being of God; ſo they found theſe Scriptures to reſtrain this Plurality to a Trinity; of which they had, though much more darkly and confuſedly, the ſame Notions that are now among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew that there is ground for this Doctrine in the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I might ſhew this oftentimes in theſe Scriptures where God is ſpoken of, there is ſome kind of intimation given of Three in the Divine Nature: But of this I ſhall only touch upon it; my intention being chiefly to ſhew, That there are Three that are called God in the Old Teſtament, and to ſhew who they are.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:93550:82"/>
               <p>I need not prove it of the Father, ſince it will not be denied that he is called God, by them that will deny it of any other. But I ſhall ſhew that ſometimes the Son is called ſo, whether by that name of the <hi>Son,</hi> or of the <hi>Word,</hi> or ſome other name, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit. Next I ſhall ſhew that the Spirit is ſpoken of as God; even he is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned without the Son. And laſtly, That the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are all Three mentioned as God, and all Three ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of together in ſome Texts of the Old Teſtament Scriptures.</p>
               <p>To keep to this order, I am firſt to ſhew that there is ſome kind of Intimation of a Trinity, in places where God is ſpoken of in theſe Scriptures. I ſhall name but two or three Texts of many; for I call it but an Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it may amount to thus much, that we find the Name of God repeated three times over; for it was certainly no vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition. Thus in the Bleſſing of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Numb. vi. 24, 25, 26. <hi>The Lord bleſs thee and keep thee; The Lord make his face ſhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; The Lord lift up his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon thee and give thee peace.</hi> So Iſa. xxxiii. 22. <hi>The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king, he will ſave us.</hi> So <hi>Dan.</hi> ix. 19. <hi>O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord hearken and do — defer not for thy own ſake, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like Intimation we find in thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which do both ſhew a Plurality in the Divine Nature, and reſtrain it to a Trinity. <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 3. The Prophet heard the Seraphims cry one to another, <hi>Holy, Holy,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93550:83"/> Holy, Lord God of hoſts.</hi> Theſe are Titles which taken together can belong to no one but God; and the Repetition of them ſhews ſomething in it which cannot but ſeem My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious, eſpecially to any one that conſiders thoſe other words of God ſpeaking in the ſame Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Who will go for us?</hi> words which clearly note a Plurality of Perſons, as alſo in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> xii. 4, 5. and in ſome other places.</p>
               <p>To ſhew who theſe are, we muſt conſider thoſe places of the Old Teſtament where the Son and the Holy Spirit are diſtinctly ſpoken of as ſeveral Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Son is expreſly ſpoken of by <hi>David,</hi> (who himſelf was a Type of the Meſſias, and is ſo acknowledged by the <hi>Jews</hi>), Pſal. ii. 7. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> That the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, who, as has been already proved, is called <hi>Wiſdom</hi> according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Notions, is the Son of God by Eternal Generation, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſheweth, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 23, 24. <hi>The Lord poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old; I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the Earth was; when there were no depths, I was brought forth.</hi> So in <hi>Prov.</hi> xxx. 4. <hi>Who hath eſtabliſhed all the ends of the earth? What is his name, or what is his Son's name?</hi> The Son can be underſtood of no other than of that Eternal Wiſdom that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the Creation, as was before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>Elſewhere the Son or the Word is ſpoken of according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Expoſitions of ſuch Texts, where he is not named, and yet
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93550:83"/> he is called God and Lord; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. 7. <hi>O God, thy God hath anointed thee.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the ſame Son who appeared often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the Character of the Angel of the Lord, though he was not a Created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, but the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf. This I only mention here, being to treat of it large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome of the following Chapters.</p>
               <p>That the Spirit is ſpoken of as a Perſon in Scripture, none can be ignorant of, that reads but the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where in the 2d Verſe he is named <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> and ſaid to have his part in the Work of the Creation. The <hi>Jews</hi> could not make this Spirit to be an Angel, becauſe they all agree the Angels were not yet created, when the Spirit moved upon the face of the Waters. Nor was the Spirit of God a mighty Wind, as ſome render it in that place; for as yet there was no Air, much leſs Exhalations, till this Work was paſt. But that <hi>Moſes</hi> meant a Perſon, ſufficiently appears by that which followeth, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 3. Where God ſaith, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alway ſtrive with man.</hi> It was the Holy Spirit of God that inſpired the holy Patriarchs to give thoſe Admonitions and Warnings to the wicked World of Mankind before the Flood, by which he ſtrove to bring them to Repentance. It was the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit whoſe Operations the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſenſible of, in his inſpiring the Seventy Elders, <hi>Numb.</hi> xi. 25, 26.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:93550:84"/>
               <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> no doubt, thought of thoſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> when he ſaid, in ſpeaking of the Works of the Creation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. <hi>All the hoſts of them were made by the Spirit of his mouth;</hi> and this Spirit he ſenſibly knew to be a Perſon; for thus he ſaith of himſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiii. 2, 3. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and his Word was in my tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly; In ſome places of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there are plainly Three Perſons ſpoken of together, and eſpecially in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where it ought to be remembred, that the word <hi>Elohim,</hi> Gods, does naturally import a Plurality. [<hi>R. Bechai in Gen. chap.</hi> i. 1. and others quoted in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.] Now there can be no Plural of leſs than Two in number, and therefore at leaſt God the Father, and the Word, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the firſt Verſe; the ſecond Verſe adds the Spirit of God, as it has been juſt now mentioned. And it is very natural to think that God ſpake to theſe Two, the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in Verſe 26. of that Chapter, when he ſaid, <hi>Let Us make man after Our Image;</hi> as alſo afterward, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 22. <hi>Behold the man is become as one of Us:</hi> And again, ſpeaking of the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> Gen. ix. 7. <hi>Let Us go down and confound their Language:</hi> This muſt be to Two at leaſt; for had he ſpoke to One only, he would have ſaid in the Singular Number, <hi>Come thou, and let us confound their language:</hi> The manner of ſpeaking plainly imports a Plurality; and they could be no other than thoſe Three which were ſpoken of in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:93550:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> brings in theſe Three Perſons into his Hiſtory of the firſt Creation, ſo does the Evangelical Prophet in ſpeaking of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xi. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c. The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him,</hi> i. e. upon the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, according to the received Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Iſa. xlviii. 16. <hi>The Lord hath ſent Me and his Spirit.</hi> Again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lix. 19, 20, 21. <hi>When the enemy ſhall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandard againſt him, and the Redeemer ſhall come unto Sion.</hi> Again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxi. 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah is upon Me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me.</hi> They are the words which Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 18.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs here to anſwer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the uſe that we have made of thoſe Texts wherein God ſaith WE and US in the Plural; which manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Jews</hi> cannot but ſee does denote a Plurality. <hi>R. Kimchi</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 8. makes that Obſervation: But then he fancies it is ſpoken with relation to Angels, whom God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call in by way of Conſultation.</p>
               <p>In the Text <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. thoſe whom God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults with are to ſend as well as he; and thoſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. are to make Man as well as he. And ſurely God would not join the Angels with himſelf in the ſending of his Prophets; much leſs would he give Angels a ſhare in the Glory of making Man, the Maſter-piece of the Creation. Angels are Creatures as well as Man, and were but a Day elder than he, according to ſome of the <hi>Jews;</hi> a Week old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than he they could not be: And at the making of Man it is believed with very good
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93550:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> reaſon, that thoſe Angels were not yet fallen, whom we now call Devils. It ſeems not very likely, that as ſoon as they were made God ſhould call them into Council for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of another of his Creatures; much leſs that he ſhould make them Creators together with himſelf; eſpecially when this gives them a Title to the Worſhip of Intelligent Beings, ſuch as Man; who if this had been true, ought to have worſhipp'd not only Angels but Devils, as being his Creators together with God. But the Truth is ſo far on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that as at firſt Man was made but a little lower than the Angels, ſo there is a Man ſince made Lord both of Angels and Devils, whom they are to worſhip: This I know our <hi>Unitarians</hi> will now deny. But to come to an end of this matter; It is certainly below the Infinite Majeſty of God, in any of his works whatever to ſay to any of his Creatures, <hi>Let us make,</hi> or, <hi>Let us do this or that.</hi> And for that idle Fancy of a Conſultation, it is not only abſurd in it ſelf, but it is contrary to the holy Scripture, that asks <hi>Iſa.</hi> xl. 13. <hi>Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord, or who hath been his Counſellor?</hi> Which in effect is a flat denial that there is any Creature to be call'd into Conſultation with God. And therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were to whom God ſaid this, <hi>Let us make,</hi> or, <hi>Let us do this or that,</hi> they could be no Creatures, they muſt be uncreated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings like himſelf, if there were any ſuch then in being. But that then at the Creation ſuch there were, even the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> has been ſhewn from the beginning of that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, I think beyond contradiction.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:93550:85"/>
               <p>Thus we have collected a number of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Old Teſtament, which ſpeak of a Trinity, and conſequently do reduce the Plurality which we proved before, to a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Unity of the Divine Nature. We ſee there Three diſtinct Characters of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We ſee the Generation of the Son expreſs'd, and the Miſſion of the Holy Spirit upon the Son, when he came to live in our Nature. We ſee the number Three ſtill obſerved in begging Pardon of Sins, of Bleſſings, and in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Praiſes to God, intimating there were Three from whom all good things come, and who are therefore the Objects of Prayer. It remains that we enquire whether the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which we draw from theſe Texts, were made by the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt; which is the ſecond Particular of our propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Method.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not repeat here what in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chapters I proved, That both <hi>Philo</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts had ſuch Notions of the Unity of God, as were not repugnant to his Plurality. The Reader can't have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten already a thing of ſuch importance. My buſineſs now is to ſhew that the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> plainly own Two Powers in God, which they diſtinguiſh from God, and yet call each of them God; the one being the Son of God, the other the Holy Spirit, who is called the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that I take the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts to be ancienter than <hi>Philo,</hi> yet I chuſe to begin with <hi>Philo</hi>'s Teſtimonies rather than theirs, for three Reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93550:86"/> he writ in the way of Treatiſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much larger and clearer than they did that writ only in the way of Tranſlation or Paraphraſe, adding nothing of their own but only ſometimes a very ſhort Note on the Text: And therefore their Writings are much likelier to be explained by his, than his by theirs. 2dly. Becauſe the Paſſages in <hi>Philo</hi> for the Exiſtence of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as a Perſon coeternal with the Father, are ſo evident, as to leave the <hi>Socinians</hi> no other way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering them, but to deny with Mr. <hi>N.</hi> that the Books that contain them were written by <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew.</hi> 3dly. A third Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Paſſages of <hi>Philo</hi> being written at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and abounding with Expreſſions uſed by the Apoſtles when they ſpeak of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, will contribute to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſome of the Quotations we ſhall take out of the Paraphraſes in uſe at <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe three great Cities <hi>Babylon, Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> were the three great Academies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> till the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Temple under <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> So that whatever was received among the <hi>Jews</hi> in theſe three Cities before our Saviour's time, may well paſs for the Opinion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church at that time.</p>
               <p>Let us proceed then to ſome of thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> wherein he declares that there are Two ſuch Powers in God, as we call Two Perſons; and no one ſhall make ſenſe of thoſe Paſſages, that calls them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general, he acknowledges that God hath Two Chief Supreme Powers, one of

               <p>As for the <hi>Targums,</hi> they likewiſe are very clear in this matter. For beſides the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova</hi> without any addition, they ſpeak of the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, or the <hi>Shekinah</hi> of the Lord, and that ſo often, that it will be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to quote all the places: ſome of them however muſt be cited, to put the thing out of diſpute.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where ever the words <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>Elohim</hi> are read in the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> There <hi>Onke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> commonly renders it in his <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, the Word of the Lord, as <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 20, 21. xxxi. 49. <hi>Ex.</hi> ii. 25. xvi. 8. xix. 17. xxxii. 20. <hi>Lev:</hi> xx. 23. xxvi. 49. <hi>Numb.</hi> xi. 20. xiv. 9. xxiii. 21. <hi>Deut.</hi> i. 30, 32. ii. 7. iii. 12. iv. 24, 27. v. 5. ix. 3. xx. 1. xxxi. 6, 8.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Targums</hi> commonly deſcribe the ſame Perſon under the Title of <hi>Shekinah,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, the Divine Habitation.</p>
               <p>The Origin of that expreſſion is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word which we find in <hi>Gen.</hi> ix. 27. and is repeated in many places of the Old Teſtament.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93550:88"/> in their Lexicons, takes the <hi>Shekinah</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt to be the ſame. But after all I believe that <hi>Eliah</hi> hath been miſtaken by not being fully acquainted with the Ideas of the moſt learned of his people. And indeed we ſee that the moſt famous Writers of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue put quite another ſenſe upon the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums,</hi> and decide that queſtion againſt <hi>Eliah.</hi> looking upon the <hi>Memra</hi> and the <hi>Shekinah</hi> as the ſame. So doth <hi>R. Moſes Maimonides, R. Menachem de Rakanaty,</hi> and <hi>Ramban,</hi> and <hi>R. Bachaye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very eaſie to be ſatisfied that theſe famous Authors are in the right: For if you conſider the places where <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> ſpeaks of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, you ſhall ſee that they are in the <hi>Targum</hi> explained either by the <hi>Memra da Jehova,</hi> or by the <hi>Shekinah.</hi> And on the contrary if you except very few places you ſhall find that the <hi>Targums</hi> employ the term of <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as the proper name which we have in the Original. And even to this day the <hi>Jews</hi> do oftner call the Spirit as by his proper name <hi>Ruach hakkodeſh,</hi> the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Targumiſts</hi> had the ſame Notions of theſe two that <hi>Philo</hi> had, is, I think, plain, if we compare what <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith of the two Powers of God, [<hi>De Plant. Noae. p.</hi> 172.] (whereof as we ſhewed before he hath one on each ſide of himſelf) with what we read, of the two Hands of God, in <hi>Jonathan</hi> and the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum on <hi>Ex.</hi> xv. 17. The like expreſſions are to be found in other places, too many to be here collected; but we ſhall conſider them afterwards.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:93550:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The mean while, we cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, how that Doctrine of the Trinity paſt current among the <hi>Jews</hi> of the ancient Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, though they were as zealous Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Unity of the Godhead as our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> can pretend to be at this day. No doubt the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> could have found as many Contradictions in theſe two Doctrines of Trinity and Unity, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, if they had not been more diſpoſed to ſtudy how to reconcile them together, being ſatisfied that both theſe Doctrines were part of the Revelation which God had made to their Fathers.</p>
               <p>We cannot ſay ſo altogether of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Jews,</hi> who are very much alienated from the Doctrine of the Trinity, by ſeeing much clearer Revelations of it in the New Teſtament, and eſpecially ſince they are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diſputes againſt the Chriſtians, that make Chriſt to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity, which they can by no means endure now to hear. This has ſet them to hunt for ways to avoid the Evidence of theſe Texts that ſpeak of a Plurality in the Divine Nature, and in this purſuit they forſake their ancient Guides, and ſtrangely intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and contradict one another.</p>
               <p>Some of them flatly deny that any of thoſe Plural words do denote any Plurality in God, but ſay, they ought to be underſtood as if they were written in the Singular.</p>
               <p>Others confeſs, that truly they do denote a Plurality. But that Plurality conſiſts of God and his Angels, whom he joyns with himſelf as his Counſellors. Ask but what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93550:89"/> they have in Scripture of ſuch a ſtrange way of ſpeaking, which makes God and his Angels as it were Fellows and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, they preſently alledg that one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Dan.</hi> iv. 17. <hi>This matter is by the decree of the Watchers, and the Demand of the Holy Ones.</hi> Now theſe Watchers, and theſe Holy Ones, ſay they, are the Holy Angels. But admit they are Angels, all that is ſaid of them in this Text, will not prove what they infer from it. For, 1. the thing that they would prove is falſe and contrary to Scripture, <hi>Eſ.</hi> xl. 13. which expreſly denies, that God has any Companions or Counſellors, as hath been already ſhewn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The nature, of the Works conſulted on in thoſe Texts to which they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this, is ſuch, as is infinitely above the power of any Creature, ſuch as the Creation of Man, and the confounding of Languages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In this very Text their moſt Learned Commentators <hi>R. Saadia Gaon,</hi> and <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> do not find any ſuch Conſultation of God with his Angels, as theſe <hi>Jews</hi> imagin; they do indeed find that theſe Watchers and Holy Ones, are the Holy Angels; but they ſay for the Decree <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it from the mouth of God, and it is called their Decree, becauſe they are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God to do whatever he commands them. Thus <hi>Jer.</hi> i. 10. that Prophet is ſaid <hi>to be ſet over Nations and Kingdoms to deſtroy and to throw down, to build and to plant;</hi> not that God ſhared that power with his Prophet, or took him into Councel for ſuch things, but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93550:89"/> only that he by the appointment of God, as his Miniſter, was to declare the Sentence and Judgment of God for the doing of ſuch things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This appears in the very Decree here ſpoken of, which concerns a revolution in a great Empire: But the diſpoſal of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms is that which properly belongs to the Eternal Wiſdom of God, as <hi>Solomon</hi> declares, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 15, 16. and not to Angels any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than they are employed by God for the publiſhing, or for the executing of his Sentence.</p>
               <p>But after all this, though I have admitted it that the Angels are here called Watchers, and Holy Ones, yet I am rather of opinion that theſe words do not ſignifie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but the three Perſons in the Trinity. My reaſon is, becauſe however that Notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being Angels has obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> I do not find them called ſo any where in the Old Teſtament Scriptures. But God is often ſaid to watch over his People, <hi>Gen. xxxi.</hi> 49. <hi>Pſal. vii.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; cxxvii.</hi> 1. <hi>Jer. xxxi.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp; xliv.</hi> 27. and even by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Dan. ix.</hi> 14. And for the other word that is here joyn'd with the Watchers, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Ones, however this may be uſed of Angels elſwhere, yet here it is certainly uſed of God in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 18. and that in the Plural, as it is in <hi>Joſh.</hi> xxiv. 19. and yet as there in <hi>Joſhua</hi> the <hi>Holy Gods</hi> in the Plural are the ſame with the <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Singular Number; ſo here the Watchers and the Holy Ones in the Plural are the ſame with the Watcher and Holy One in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93550:90"/> 
                  <hi>v.</hi> 13. and the Decree of the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Holy Ones in this verſe, is called the Decree of the Moſt High, <hi>v.</hi> 24. and it is he whom <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> glorifies as the ſole Author of his abaſement, and alſo of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration. I hope the Reader will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily pardon this digreſſion, if he thinks it is one: It ſeemed neceſſary that I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this Text at large, becauſe it is as far as I know, the only place in Scripture which is brought by the <hi>Jews</hi> to colour that Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with which they think to elude the force of our Arguments.</p>
               <p>After all that I have alledged from <hi>Philo,</hi> and the Paraphraſes, I do not pretend to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they had as diſtinct Notions of the Trinity as we have; nor do I deny but that ſometimes they put a different conſtruction on the Texts which we have cited in proof of this Myſtery; Nay, I own that their Ideas are often confuſed when they ſpeak of theſe things, and particularly they refer ſometimes that to the ſecond Perſon which ſhould be aſcribed to the third, and that to the third which properly belongs to the ſecond; Nay, more, I acknowledg that <hi>Philo</hi> by the Spirit, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 2. underſtands the Wind, [<hi>de Gig. p.</hi> 223.] which is ſomething ſtrange; ſeeing the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters whom he followed read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Spirit of God, and not ſimply the Spirit, which might have ſtood for Wind here, as it does in ſome places of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Philo</hi>'s Error is eaſily accounted for; He fell into it by endeavouring to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date <hi>Moſes</hi> his Notions to the Notions of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93550:90"/> Philoſophy, that makes four Elements of all things. And probably for ſuch a reaſon ſome of the <hi>Targums</hi> might come into the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. But for the other ancient <hi>Jews</hi> they expounded this Spirit, not by Wind, but by that Spirit which was to reſt on the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Language, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xi. 1. See <hi>Breſh. Rabba</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 2. And truly <hi>Raſhi</hi> on theſe words affirms, that the Throne of Glory was in the Air, and that it warmed the Heavens by the Spirit of the Goodneſs of God bleſſed for ever. Where by the way the Spirit of Goodneſs is the ſame with the latter of <hi>Philo's</hi> two Powers above mentioned. <hi>De Sacr. Ab.</hi> 108.</p>
               <p>Thoſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> who take the Spirit of God for the Will of God, as <hi>R. Abr.</hi> doth in <hi>Tzeror hammor,</hi> and ſome mentioned in the Book <hi>Cozri, [p.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 329.] are not far from this Opinion: And this is the ſenſe <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> gives to thoſe words, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord,</hi> in explaining of <hi>Iſa.</hi> xl. 13. [<hi>Mor. Neb.</hi> i. 40.] It appears from <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. That <hi>the Hoſts of Heaven were made by the Spirit of his mouth;</hi> words which no <hi>Jew</hi> has yet interpreted of the Wind.</p>
               <p>I know <hi>Philo</hi> expreſſes his thoughts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, ſpeaking of the two Powers of God, [<hi>de Cherub. p.</hi> 86.] he ſaith, that the Word joyns theſe two Powers, which he afterwards calls his Principality and his Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>But this can raiſe no prejudice againſt our Poſition. It ſhews indeed that our Author, who had gathered his Notions, as other <hi>Jews</hi> did, from reading the Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, together with their Traditional In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93550:91"/> was not ſo much a Maſter of them, as to make them always conſiſt with one another. Others perhaps will ſay, he was not always conſtant to himſelf; nor am I concern'd to have it granted that he was ſo. We look not on him, nor any of theſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be inſpired; but eſteem them only as Eminent Divines of the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and conſequently as ſubject to ſeveral weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and overſights, which are common to the greateſt as well as to the meaneſt men. Even the moſt Learned Men in all Ages, though they agree in the truth of certain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, are yet often divided in their ways of expreſſing them; and alſo in their ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on this or that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince Chriſt's time, we are leſs concern'd what they ſay, becauſe when they had once rejected their <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they ſoon found that if they ſtood to their Traditional Expoſitions of Scripture, it could not be denied, but he whom they had rejected was the Word the Son of God, whom their Fathers expected to come in our Fleſh; but rather than yield to that, they would alter their Creed, and either wholly throw out the Word the Son of God, or bring him down to the ſtate of a created Angel, as we ſee ſome of them do now in their ordinary Comments on Scripture. And ſo they deal with the <hi>Shekinah</hi> likewiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Maſter with the Servant, as we ſee that ſome few perhaps one or two Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have done in their Books.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:93550:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>In conſequence of this alteration, they are forc'd to acknowledg, the Patriarchs <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> worſhipped a created Angel; and have left themſelves no way to excuſe them from Idolatry therein, but by corrupting their Doctrine concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip, and teaching that it is lawful to pray to theſe Miniſtring Spirits, which is effectually the ſetting up of other Gods, plainly contrary to the firſt Commandment of their Law. Some of themſelves are ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this, that they cannot deny it to be Idolatry. Which is certainly the more inexcuſable in the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe on other occaſions they conſtantly affirm, that when God charged the Angels with the care of other Nations, he reſerved to himſelf the ſole Government of his people <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> xxxii. 8, 9. And therefore it muſt be a grievous ſin in them to worſhip Angels, howſoever they ſhould imagin it might be permitted to other Nations.</p>
               <p>After all this they have not been able ſo totally to ſuppreſs the ancient Tradition, but that in their Writers ſince Chriſt's time there appear ſome footſteps of it ſtill: And that it is ſo I am next to ſhew, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their averſneſs to the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they yet have a Notion diſtinct e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough both of a Plurality and Trinity in the Divine Nature, which will be the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of my next Chapter.</p>

               </head>
               <head type="sub">That this Notion of a Trinity in the Divine Nature has continued among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſince the time of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
               <p>TO begin with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors who have writ <hi>Medraſhim,</hi> that is, a ſort of <hi>Allegorical Commentaries</hi> upon Scripture, and the <hi>Cabaliſtical Jews,</hi> whom their people look upon as the wiſeſt Men of their Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that know the truth more than all others, among them <hi>this truth</hi> paſſes for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted.</p>
               <p>I know very well that the method of thoſe Cabaliſtical Men, who ſeek for Myſteries al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every Letter of the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath made them juſtly ridiculous. And indeed one cannot imagin an occupation more vain or uſeleſs, than the prodigious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which they undergo in their way of <hi>Gematria, Notarikon,</hi> and <hi>Tſirouph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides that Vice is not ſo general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> I am fully reſolved to lay aſide in this Controverſie all ſuch remarks; my deſign being only to ſhew that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tradition hath been kept among thoſe Authors, who have their Name from their firm adherence to the Tradition of their Forefathers.</p>
               <p>So I am not willing to deny that ſome of the Books of thoſe Cabaliſtical Authors,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93550:92"/> which the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are not great Criticks, look upon as very ancient, are not as to all their parts of ſuch an antiquity as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſuppoſe them to be. But I take notice that thoſe who attack the antiquity of thoſe Books are not aware that notwithſtanding ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which are in thoſe Books, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the <hi>Zohar,</hi> and in the <hi>Rabboth,</hi> the very Doctrine of the Synagogue is to be found there, and the ſame as it is repreſented to us by the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Authors, by <hi>Philo,</hi> or thoſe who had occaſion to mention the Doctrine of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all, let us ſuppoſe that almoſt all thoſe Books have been written ſince the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and that the <hi>Talmud</hi> was written ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſeventh Century, that could not be a prejudice againſt the Doctrine which the <hi>Jews</hi> propoſe as the ancient Doctrine of the Synagogue; But to the contrary it would be a ſtrong proof of the conſtancy of thoſe Authors in keeping the Tradition of their Anceſtors in ſo ſtrange a diſperſion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many Nations; chiefly ſince in the Articles, upon which I ſhall quote their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, they ſo exactly follow the ſteps of the Authors of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and of their ancient Paraphraſt, who had more penetrated into the ſenſe of Scripture.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that both the Authors of the <hi>Midraſhim</hi> and the Cabaliſtical Authors agree exactly in this, that they acknowledg a Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in the Divine Eſſence, and that they reduce ſuch a Plurality to three Perſons, as we do.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:93550:93"/>
               <p>To prove ſuch an aſſertion, I take notice firſt, That the <hi>Jews</hi> do judg as we do, that the word <hi>Elohim,</hi> which is Plural, expreſſes a Plurality. Their ordinary remark upon that word is this, that <hi>Elohim</hi> is as if one did read, <hi>El hem,</hi> that is, <hi>They are God. Bachajè</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Commentator of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> who brings in his work all the ſenſes of the four ſorts of Interpreters among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſpeaks to this purpoſe upon the <hi>Paraſcha Breſchit. fol.</hi> 2. <hi>col.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It is certain that they make uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to expreſs thoſe Perſons, as they uſe to expreſs the two firſt human Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>viz. Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Thus ſpeaks of them the ſame <hi>Bachaje, Ibid. fol.</hi> 13. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. They fix the number of three Perſons in the Divine Eſſence, diſtinguiſhing their Perſonal Characters and Actions, which ſerve to make them known.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. They ſpeak of the emanation of the two laſt from the firſt, and that the laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. They declare that this Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Myſtery that is incomprehenſible, and above human reaſon, and that in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable ſecret we muſt acquieſce with the Authority of the Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. They ground this Doctrine upon the very ſame Texts of Scripture, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to prove the ſeveral Poſitions of ours, which deſerves a great deal of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And indeed thoſe things being ſo, we muſt neceſſarily conclude, either that they mock their Readers, or that they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93550:93"/> what they ſay, or one muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the conſequences and concluſions, which Chriſtians draw from the Scriptures to this ſubject of Trinity, are not ſo eaſie to be avoided as the <hi>Socinians</hi> believe.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader reflect upon each of thoſe Articles, while I ſhall bring him witneſſes to eſtabliſh them.</p>
               <p>I know that they pretend commonly the name of <hi>Elohim,</hi> which is Plural, is given to God to expreſs his ſeveral Virtues: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, they maintain that Scripture hath affected this ſtyle of Plurality becauſe of thoſe two, the <hi>Cochma</hi> or Wiſdom, and the <hi>Bina</hi> or underſtanding which are ſpoken <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.19. where <hi>Solomon</hi> reflects upon the Author of the Creation, and they alledg upon this Subject, the place of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, ch.</hi> xii. 1. where <hi>Creators</hi> are mentioned. <hi>Bachaje in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. fol.</hi> 4. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; col.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; R. Joſeph de Kar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitol in Saare Tſedec. fol.</hi> 7. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>As they ſtudy in a ſpecial manner the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Creation, and conſider very nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every expreſſion thereof, they take notice that the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum hath tranſlated thoſe words in the beginning, <hi>Bereſhit,</hi> God created Heaven and Earth; by theſe, God created by his Wiſdom, which is call'd the beginning, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. and ſo that <hi>Onkelos</hi> hath not tranſlated the word <hi>Bereſchit,</hi> by the word <hi>Kadmita,</hi> which ſignifies the beginning of time; but by the word <hi>Bekadmin,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the ancient or the firſt, which is the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they give to Wiſdom, according to the ſame place of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which I have quoted. This is the Notion of the Book <hi>Habbahir,</hi> of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93550:94"/> the <hi>Zohar,</hi> of the <hi>Rabboth,</hi> whoſe words are related at large by <hi>R. Menachem de Rekanati</hi> in <hi>Pentat. fol.</hi> 1. <hi>col.</hi> 1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. of the <hi>Venice</hi> Edit. by <hi>Bombergue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They maintain the Wiſdom which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by <hi>Solomon</hi> to be the cauſe by which all particular Beings have been formed, and they call it the ſecond number, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the firſt, as from his ſpring, and brings from it the influx of all bleſſings. This is the Doctrine of <hi>R. Nechouniah ben Cana,</hi> and of the Author of <hi>Rabboth,</hi> which <hi>R. Menachem</hi> quotes at large, <hi>Ibid. fol.</hi> 1. <hi>col.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>They teach that becauſe God hath created by his Wiſdom, as the Soul acts by her Body, they cannot ſay there was not an abſolute and perfect unity in the work of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is the Doctrine of the <hi>Zohar,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>R. Menachem de Rekanat. Ibid. col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And indeed they acknowledg not only that Wiſdom to have been the efficient cauſe of the Word, but they acknowledg alſo the <hi>Bina,</hi> as ſuch an efficient cauſe with God; from hence they pretend that God hath founded the World by his two Hands, as it is ſaid by <hi>Iſa. ch.</hi> xlviii. 13. ſo <hi>Bachaje</hi> in <hi>Gen. fol.</hi> 3. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And this Notion agreeth exactly with what is ſaid by <hi>Moſes</hi> that the Spirit of God moved it ſelf upon the face of the Abyſs. For it was not of a created wind, but of a Divine and Increated Being which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks there, and which is ſpoken of by <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. as it is acknowledged by <hi>Leo Hebraeus Dial. de Amore,</hi> and by <hi>Menaſſeh ben Iſrael Concil. in Gen. Q.</hi> 2. §. 7. and by many others.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:93550:94"/>
               <p>It is to be noted, as the firſt Chriſtians make uſe of the word <hi>Number,</hi> when they ſpeak of the Divine Wiſdom, acknowledging that it differs in Number, but not in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Eternal Father; So <hi>Juſtin</hi> doth againſt <hi>Tryphon;</hi> and do acknowledge ſome degrees between the Three Perſons: So doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> in ſome places; and afterwards they have made uſe of the word Perſon: So the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> have among them the ſame Terms, which ſhews they had the ſame Ideas: They ſpeak of the <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Numbers</hi> in the Godhead; they ſpeak of the ſeveral <hi>Madregoth,</hi> which is <hi>Degrees;</hi> they ſpeak of <hi>Proſopin,</hi> which is <hi>Perſons,</hi> as I have ſhewn before.</p>
               <p>They cannot expreſs their mind more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, than when they diſtinguiſh, 1. <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> which is the Characteriſtical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Perſons, and when they apply theſe Pronouns to the Perſons which they conceive in the Godhead: So they ſay that <hi>Thou</hi> belongs to Wiſdom, and <hi>He</hi> to the God which is abſconded. <hi>R. Menach. Ibid. fol.</hi> 22. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 45. <hi>col.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>They give to them their Characteriſtical Names; ſo they make the name <hi>Anochi</hi> to belong to God abſconded; they refer the name of <hi>any</hi> to the <hi>Shekinah</hi> or <hi>Memra,</hi> which is the ſame to them, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards. See <hi>R. Menach. in Pent. fol.</hi> 149. <hi>col.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>They refer to theſe Perſons the Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Speeches of God, as directed to many; as, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> which contains a deep Myſtery, as ſays <hi>Bachaje;</hi> (but which others would elude, by maintaining that God
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93550:95"/> ſpeaks to Angels): So doth <hi>R. Menach. de Rek. fol.</hi> 35. <hi>col.</hi> 4. So they conceive that when it is ſaid in Scripture that God ſpeaks with his Heart, then God ſpeaks with his <hi>Shekinah:</hi> 'Tis their Remark upon <hi>Gen.</hi> xi. <hi>Let us come down. R. Men. fol.</hi> 27. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 28. <hi>col.</hi> 2. So they acknowledge diſtinctly in theſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> xix. 24. <hi>And</hi> Jehovah <hi>rained upon Sodom from</hi> Jehovah; that thoſe Two <hi>Jehovah</hi> are Two Perſons, which they call expreſly <hi>Two Proſopin. R. Menach. fol.</hi> 11. <hi>col.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 63. <hi>col.</hi> 4. So in the Hiſtory of the Tower of <hi>Babel. Ibid. fol.</hi> 28. <hi>col.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>They diſtinguiſh exactly the Characteriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Actions which belong to theſe Perſons. So they attribute to the God abſconded, to have acted in the Creation by his Wiſdom, and by his Underſtanding. <hi>R. Menach. fol.</hi> 1. from <hi>Breſchit Rabba;</hi> and that according to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Prov. iii. and to <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. xxxiii. 6.</p>
               <p>They ſay that this Wiſdom is called the <hi>Beginning,</hi> although ſhe is but the ſecond <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> becauſe beyond her they can know nothing, the firſt <hi>Sephira</hi> being unknown to all Creatures. 'Tis the Doctrine of the Book <hi>Jetzira,</hi> and of the <hi>Zohar</hi> related by <hi>R. Men. fol.</hi> 1. <hi>col.</hi> 3. They maintain that 'tis the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinah</hi> or Wiſdom which rules the World, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s words, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. <hi>R.

               <p>I ſhall ſhew in one of the next Chapters, that they refer to the <hi>Shekinah</hi> or <hi>Memra,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Appearances of God which are mentioned in Scripture, according to the Ideas of the <hi>Targum.</hi> That can be ſeen in the Comments of <hi>Ramban</hi> and of <hi>Bachaje</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:93550:95"/> upon the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> I quote here only <hi>R. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachem,</hi> becauſe he brings the very Words of the Authors who lived before him; ſo that his Authority is not alone, but upheld by the Conſent of old Authors.</p>
               <p>Now he and his Authors teach conſtantly, That 'twas the <hi>Shekinah</hi> which appeared to <hi>Adam</hi> after his Sin, and made him ſome Cloaths, <hi>fol.</hi> 59. <hi>col.</hi> 4. That it appeared to <hi>Abraham, fol.</hi> 35. <hi>col.</hi> 2. That it appeared to <hi>Jacob</hi> at Night, <hi>fol.</hi> 36. <hi>col.</hi> 2.

               <p>So they give to the <hi>Shekinah</hi> the Character of Ruler and Conducter of the Animals of Glory, who receive their Virtue from the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> and live by his Glory, <hi>fol.</hi> 65. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 66. <hi>col.</hi> 4.

               <p>They call the <hi>Shekinah</hi> the <hi>Adam</hi> of above, after whoſe Image <hi>Adam</hi> was created: And they give to him the Titles of <hi>Exalted</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> which they give only to the True God, <hi>R. Men. fol.</hi> 14. <hi>col.</hi> 3. They ſay, That

               <p>They pretend that the <hi>Shekinah</hi> is the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom of the Synagogue, according to the Idea of God by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lxii. 3. <hi>R.

And that it was to him, and not to the Ark, that the <hi>Levites</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ariſe, O Lord, into thy reſt, Thou and the Ark of thy ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. cxxxii. 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 121. <hi>col.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>In a word, they look upon the <hi>Shekinah</hi> as the Living God, <hi>fol.</hi> 2. <hi>col.</hi> 1. The God of <hi>Jacob, R. Men. fol.</hi> 38. <hi>col.</hi> 3.

               <p>They are no leſs poſitive, when they ſpeak of the Third <hi>Sephira,</hi> which they call <hi>Binah,</hi> and which we take juſtly to be the Holy Ghoſt. For they teach that it proceeds from the Firſt by the Second; and who can conceive that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93550:96"/> the Spirit of God is not God? And 'tis alſo the Doctrine of the <hi>Zohar,</hi> and of the Book <hi>Habbahir,</hi> related by <hi>R. Menachem, fol.</hi> 1. <hi>col.</hi> 3. The very Book of <hi>Zohar</hi> ſaith, That the word <hi>Jehovah</hi> expreſſes both the Wiſdom and the <hi>Binah,</hi> and calls them Father and Mother, <hi>R. Men. fol.</hi> 3. <hi>col.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 10. <hi>col.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>This Idea is grounded upon what is ſaid, <hi>Thou art our Father,</hi> which they refer to the <hi>Shekinah, fol.</hi> 22. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; col.</hi> 3. And they call her upon that account the Mother of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and her Tutor, <hi>R. Men. fol.</hi> 62. <hi>col.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 64. <hi>col.</hi> 4. That Idea of the Holy Ghoſt as a Mother, which <hi>R.

               <p>They ſpeak of the Spirit as of a Perſon, when they look upon a Man as a Prophet, who is ſent by God, and by his Spirit, <hi>Iſa. chap.</hi> xlviii. <hi>R.

(Which is now turned by ſome other <hi>Jews,</hi> as ſignifying only a Created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; as you ſee in <hi>Bachaje,</hi> at the end of the <hi>Paraſha Breſchith, fol.</hi> 18. <hi>col.</hi> 1.) So they ſpeak of the Holy Ghoſt as being the <hi>mouth of God, fol.</hi> 127. <hi>col.</hi> 4. And that the Angels have been created by the Mouth of God, <hi>fol.</hi> 143. <hi>col.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>I acknowledg that ſometimes ſome of them ſeem to take the <hi>Shekinah</hi> for the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93550:97"/> and the Holy Ghoſt for the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> although they commonly call one the Second <hi>Sephira,</hi> and the other the Third, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Binah,</hi> that is to be ſeen in <hi>R. Men. fol.</hi> 80. <hi>col.</hi> 2. So ſome of them refer to the <hi>Binah</hi> the Title of King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which occurs ſo often in Scripture: See <hi>Men. fol.</hi> 132. <hi>col.</hi> 3. Although it is the common Name of the <hi>Shekinah, fol.</hi> 113. <hi>col.</hi> 1. Some other refer to the <hi>Shekinah</hi> the Name of the Spirit of God, which is mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 1. So ſays the Author of the Book <hi>Jetzira, in R. Menachem, fol.</hi> 3. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But if ſome are miſtaken in their Ideas, I can ſay that they are very few, and almoſt not worth taking notice of. And indeed if we conſider a little what is the general Senſe of thoſe Authors about the Emanations which are ſpoken of in Scripture, as by which the Divine Nature is communicated to the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And firſt the Author of the <hi>Zohar,</hi> and the Author of the Book <hi>Habbahir,</hi> pronounce that the Third <hi>Sephira</hi> proceeds from the Firſt by the Second; and <hi>R. Men.</hi> follows their Doctrine, <hi>fol.</hi> 1. <hi>col.</hi> 3.</p>

                  <hi>the Infinite;</hi> and he follows in that <hi>Rabbi Salomon Jarchi,</hi> who ſaith upon <hi>Iſa.</hi> xi. that the <hi>Cochma</hi> which is the ſecond <hi>Sephira</hi> ſhall be in the middle of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word this Notion of Plurality and Trinity expreſſed in the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets hath not only been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but they have found and acknowledged it as well as the Chriſtians to be a great and profound myſtery. And for the explaining of it the <hi>Jews</hi> have employed very near the ſame Ideas that the Chriſtians uſe in ſpeaking of the three Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity. For they conceive in God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Faces, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Subſiſtences, which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93550:99"/> we call Perſons, as one may ſee in <hi>Sepher Jetzirah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, we may obſerve, 1. That when they ſpeak of the three firſt <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> they underſtand the ſame thing by them, as we do by three Perſonalities, three Modes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, active or paſſive Emanations or Proceſſions, which are the foundation of the Perſonalities.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That though they hold ten <hi>Sephiroth</hi> in all, yet they make a great difference between the three firſt <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> and the ſeven laſt. For they regard the firſt as Perſons, but the laſt as Attributes, according to which God acts in the ordinary courſe of his Providence, or according to his ſeveral diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Creatures. Hence they call the ſeven laſt, <hi>Middoth,</hi> or Meaſures, that is to ſay, the Attributes and Characters which are viſible in the Works of God, namely, his Juſtice and Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in plain words by the great Cabaliſt <hi>R. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachem de Rekanati: Tres primariae numerationes, quae ſunt intellectuales, non vocantur menſurae,</hi> i.e. they are not Attributes, as are the ſeven laſt which he explains under that Notion. <hi>Rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangel</hi> hath already quoted that place in his Notes upon <hi>Sepher Jetzira, p.</hi> 193.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were ignorant of the Names of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which Names the Chriſtians give to the three Perſons in the Deity. But this, if it were true, would not weigh much with a reaſonable mind. For who can doubt but a new Revelation may diſtinguiſh thoſe Notions clearly by proper and ſuitable Names,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93550:99"/> which the <hi>Jews</hi> by what Revelation they had, knew but more confuſedly. And yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Objection wholly, it is certain the ancient Cabaliſts were acquainted with the Names of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>They gave the Name of Father to the firſt of their <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> whom they called <hi>En Soph, i. e. Infinite,</hi> to expreſs his Incomprehenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This we have in <hi>Zohar,</hi> from whence it is eaſie to conclude that they muſt own the Son alſo, the Name of Father being relative to the Son. But further they knew that ſecond Perſon by the name <hi>Coema</hi> Wiſdom, even that Wiſdom by which the Word was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.19. <hi>The Lord by Wiſdom hath founded the Earth.</hi> This Notion was ſo ancient among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum hath rendred the firſt verſe of <hi>Geneſis</hi> thus, <hi>The Lord created by his Wiſdom.</hi> The Chriſtians call'd him the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> alluding to divers places, eſpecially <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. and <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 14. The <hi>Jews</hi> commonly call him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ſecond Glory, and the Crown of the Creation. <hi>Rittanget.</hi> brings their Authorities for this in <hi>Seph. Jetzira p.</hi> 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>They knew the third Perſon by the name of <hi>Binah,</hi> or Intelligence, becauſe they thought it was he that gave Men the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of what God was pleaſed to reveal to them. In particular, they called him the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier, and the Father of Faith: nor is any thing more common among them than to give him the name of the Spirit of Holineſs, or the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:93550:100"/>
               <p>The ſame Doctrine is to be found in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Books of the Cabaliſts which are known to moſt Chriſtians, becauſe they are Printed; and the ſame thing is to be found in their Manuſcripts, which are more rare, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> have not yet Printed them. Of this ſort is <hi>Iggereth Haſſodoth,</hi> cited by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinus,</hi> whoſe Authority is vindicated by <hi>Plantavitius Bibl. Rabb. p.</hi> 549. Of this ſort alſo is the Manuſcript called <hi>Sod Mercava Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ona</hi> quoted by <hi>Ritt. p.</hi> 35. where are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the three Modes of Exiſtence in God. Notwithſtanding which they are all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that the Lord is one, and his Name is one.</p>
               <p>If you would know on what foundations it was that the Cabaliſts built this Doctrine, you need but look over the Texts on which they have reflected, and you'l find them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the ſame with thoſe that were quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſame purpoſe by the Apoſtles and Apoſtolical Men in their Writings.</p>
               <p>Particularly if you would know their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to whom it was that God did ſpeak at the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. <hi>R. Juda</hi> will tell you God ſpoke to his Word.</p>
               <p>If you would know of them who is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of whom we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 2. <hi>that he moved on the face of the Waters. Moſes Botril</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, it is the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>If you would learn of them to whom it was that God ſpoke, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. ſaying, <hi>Let Us make Man. Moſes Botril</hi> tells us that theſe words are directed to the Wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p>If you would know what Spirit it was
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93550:100"/> that is ſpoken of, <hi>Job</hi> xxviii. 12. Again <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Botril</hi> will tell you, it is the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>If you would know of whom they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxvi. 6. They ſay plainly that they are ſpoken of that very Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>If you would know what they think of that Wiſdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> civ. 24. <hi>R. Moſes Botril</hi> deſcribes it to you as a Perſon, and not an Attribute.</p>
               <p>If you would know to whom that is to be referr'd, which we read of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xl. 14. <hi>R. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham ben David</hi> will tell you, to the Three <hi>Sephiroth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is to be found in their ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Book <hi>Jetzira,</hi> which were printed at <hi>Mantua</hi> in the laſt Century, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1562. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1592. and have been quoted in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> by <hi>Rittangelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, That the <hi>Jews</hi> have adopted this Doctrine inconſiderately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting upon the Abſurdity of it. For how is it poſſible to conceive ſuch Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in God, who is Immutable and Eternal; and ſuch an Idea of Plurality and of Trinity in God, who is over and above all Ideas of Compoſition?</p>
               <p>But I anſwer, 1. All theſe they have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and yet have owned this Diſtinction in the Divine Eſſence, as a Truth not to be conteſted. But aſſert theſe Three <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> which they call ſometimes Spirits, to be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Eſſential in God; which they ſay we ought not to deny, becauſe we can't ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceive it: For the Divine Nature is Incomprehenſible, far exceeding the Limits
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93550:101"/> of our narrow Underſtandings: And the Revelation God hath given us does no more put us in a capacity to judge of the nature of the things revealed, than the borrowed Light of the Moon, which is all that the Owls can behold, does render them able to judge of the Sun's far more glorious Light. Such are the Thoughts of <hi>R. Sabtay in Rit.</hi> on <hi>Jetz. p.</hi> 78, 79, 80. Such are the Reflections of <hi>R. Menach.</hi> who cites <hi>Job</hi> xxviii. 7. to this purpoſe; and the Caution of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, who forbid to undertake the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of things that are incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They have expreſſed their Notions of this matter much after the ſame manner as the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> have done theirs. The Book <hi>Jet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zira, chap.</hi> 1. diſtinguiſhes in God, <hi>Sopher, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> and <hi>Sippour;</hi> which <hi>R. Abraham</hi> explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſays they anſwer to Him that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, to the Act of Underſtanding, and to the Thing underſtood.</p>
               <p>All this is ſtill the more remarkable, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the common <hi>Jews</hi> have well nigh quite loſt the Notion of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> being God; and they generally expect no other than a mere common Man for their Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the main Body of the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſuch zealous Aſſerters of the Unity of God, that they repeat every day the words of <hi>Deut.</hi> vi. 4. <hi>The Lord our God is One Lord.</hi> It is a Practice which though now they have turn'd againſt the Chriſtians, yet doubtleſs was taken up firſt in oppoſition to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> whoſe Polytheiſm was renounced in this ſhort Confeſſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith. And
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93550:101"/> hence it is that they do ſo much celebrate <hi>R. Akiba</hi>'s Faith, who died in Torments, with the laſt Syllables of the word <hi>Echad</hi> in his Mouth, which ſignifies the Unity of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> at the ſame time diſpute againſt the Chriſtians Doctrine of the Trinity; as doth <hi>R. Saadia,</hi> for inſtance, in his Book entituled <hi>Sepher Emunah, chap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe from the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſome <hi>Rabbins</hi> have applied themſelves to find out other Senſes of thoſe Paſſages which the Chriſtians urge againſt them. This we ſee in <hi>Gem.</hi> of <hi>Sanhedr. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding all this oppoſition, the <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> have paſt and do ſtill paſs for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Targumiſts</hi> for Inſpired Men.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to be imagined that theſe Notions of the Cabaliſtical <hi>Jews</hi> are new things, which they pick'd up ſince their more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Converſe with the Chriſtians: For we find them in the Book <hi>Zohar,</hi> the Author of which is reputed one of the chief <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Martyrs (<hi>Jebhamoth, tr.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 5. <hi>col.</hi> 2.), and to have lived in the Second Century. I know ſome have ſuſpected that this Book is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and falſly fathered on <hi>R. Simeon,</hi> whoſe Name it bears. The <hi>Zohar</hi> was not known, ſay they, till about the time of <hi>R. Moſes Bar Nachman:</hi> So ſaith the Book <hi>Juchazin, p.</hi> 42. <hi>&amp; R. D. Ganz in Tzemach David, p.</hi> 106. But we find theſe Notions in the beginning of the <hi>Rabboth,</hi> which Books they will have to be more Ancient than the <hi>Talmud.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, we ſee in the <hi>Gemara</hi> of <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93550:102"/> 
                  <hi>R. Simeon</hi> was diſpenſed with the neceſſity of his being preſent at Prayers in the Synagogue, becauſe he and his Scholars were at work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Study of the Laws; which ſuppoſes that he was writing ſome ſuch Comments as we have now, although 'tis probable that they have been increaſed in following Ages. Beſides, who can imagine that in all places the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have adopted Opinions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to their Religion, and in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of thoſe Points for which they then zealouſly contended, if they had not been convinced of the Truth of ſuch a Doctrine?</p>
               <p>And now give me leave to propoſe one Argument to the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> which I believe they will not be able to anſwer, and adhere to their new-advanced Poſition, That the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> were the true Primitive Chriſtians, and the only Depoſitaries of the Apoſtolick Doctrine. It is a Paſſage taken from the Goſpel of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> as cited by St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. Where after noting that the word <hi>Ruach,</hi> Spirit, in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue is Feminine; he adds, <hi>In Evangelio quoque He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeorum, quod lectitant Nazaraei, Salvator in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducitur l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>quens,</hi> Modo me arripuit Mater mea, Spiritus Sanctus. This Paſſage of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi>'s Goſpel would never have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if we had not known that the <hi>Jews</hi> call the Holy Spirit <hi>Imma,</hi> Mother, as well as <hi>Binah,</hi> Underſtanding; as we ſee in <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har</hi> and other Cabaliſts. And perhaps from hence <hi>Philo de Temul.</hi> calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the World.</p>
               <p>Nor are we to fancy that the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> oppoſe the <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> herein. No; <hi>Maimonides,</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:93550:102"/> who is a <hi>Talmudiſt,</hi> agrees in this with the <hi>Cabaliſts;</hi> as appears from his Book <hi>de funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. legis, ch.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; Mor. Neb. p.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Nor is it to be urged againſt what I have ſaid, that the <hi>Jews</hi> have formal Diſputes againſt the Doctrine of the Trinity, as <hi>Saadiah Sepher Emunoth, ch.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; Maim. Mor. Neb. p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 71. For we may remember, 1. That all their Diſputes with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are built on this wrong bottom, That the Chriſtians are Tritheiſts, and deny the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Deity. 2. That almoſt all thoſe who diſpute againſt the Chriſtians on this Head, contradict themſelves in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that are not Polemical, but are drawn up in cool Blood, out of the heat of diſpute; of which <hi>Saadiah Haggaen,</hi> as I have ſhewed before, is a Proof. 3. The Study of their Rites having been the great buſineſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> for many Centuries, it hath happen'd that their greateſt Authors have applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but little to the Study of the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning their Doctrines. In <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> one of the greateſt Men the <hi>Jews</hi> ever had, we have a plain Example of it: He tells us, That it was towards the declenſion of his Life before he could turn himſelf to ſtudy their Traditions; and he laments his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, in that he could not begin this Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſooner. This is related by <hi>R. Elias Chaiim,</hi> who ſaith he had it from a Letter of <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> to one of his Scholars.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid before, that theſe Notions of the Cabaliſt <hi>Jews</hi> are received in all parts of the World where the <hi>Jews</hi> are found in any numbers: And I ſay it not without good
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93550:103"/> reaſon: For 1. The <hi>Rabboth</hi> are Books recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved whereever there are <hi>Jews:</hi> Now this Book begins with the Notion of a Second Perſon. 2. For the <hi>Cabaliſts,</hi> they are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the other <hi>Jews;</hi> and in all places where Learning is cultivated, and Study en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, there they are to be found. 3. We may well infer the Univerſality of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, from the ſeveral different Authors that have written alike on this Subject, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Conſent or Communication together that we know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Saadiah Hagaon</hi> writ in <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Tenth Century. He was an <hi>Egyptian</hi> by Birth, and the Tranſlator of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> into <hi>Arabick,</hi> and wrote a bitter Book againſt the Chriſtians (which hath been printed at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and ſince at <hi>Amſterdam</hi>) where he diſputes againſt the Chriſtians Trinity; yet he teaches not only the Unity, but this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from everlaſting in the Deity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Moſes Bar Nachman</hi> in the Thirteenth Century, and <hi>R. Judas</hi> the <hi>Levite</hi> writ in <hi>Spain,</hi> and yet we ſee how they agree in their Notions with the <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed other-where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Aaron</hi> writ at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and yet his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as exactly like thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> as if he had trod in their Steps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Moſes Botril</hi> writ in <hi>France,</hi> and he teaches the ſame things. He that would ſee the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at large, may conſult their Comment on the Book <hi>Jetzira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is now time to return to the Judgment of the Ancient Synagogue, and to conſider how it agrees or differs with us in the other Matters we have in hand.</p>

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:93550:104"/>
               <p>It cannot be denied us that St. <hi>John</hi> being one of the Circumciſion did write with an eſpecial reſpect to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they might underſtand him, and receive benefit by it; and therefore it cannot be doubted but that when he called Jeſus Chriſt the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>There is no need of making any profound Reflections on theſe many places of <hi>Philo,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſes, to convince the Reader, that the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt did regard the Word as a true and real Perſon. The conſequence is eaſily drawn by him that looks them over but with half an eye.</p>
               <p>I know the word <hi>Memra</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken in another ſenſe, as well as that of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is in the <hi>Greek.</hi> But all the Perſonal Characters of Action, of Commanding, of Speaking, of Anſwering, of giving Laws, of Iſſuing out Decrees, of being prayed to, of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93550:109"/> receiving Worſhip, and the like, are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly given that Word we now Treat of, as render it abſurd to take it for any thing elſe but a Perſon.</p>
               <p>Let us next enquire into the Nature of this Perſon, according to the ſame Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> whether it be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, or Divine, and conſequently whether this Perſon be truly God.</p>
               <p>I propoſe this, not that I think there is any neceſſity of proving it after all that I have already obſerved from the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> touching the Word; but for the clearer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the abſurdity into which our Adverſaries fall, in their ſtriving to force an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſenſe upon the word, as the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men among them cannot but ſee, when they conſider theſe Proofs with attention.</p>
               <p>He who writ againſt <hi>Vechnerus</hi> Endeavours in general to perſwade us, that in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Targums</hi> where the <hi>Memra</hi> is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, it is uſed to expreſs the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over the Faithful of ancient times; or elſe in particular it ſignifies the Attributes of God, his Affections or Actions, his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, his Appearances, his Inſpirations, and the like. This he repeats in ſeveral parts of his diſſertation, and at the end of his work he trys to apply it to ſeveral Texts in the <hi>Targum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One might reaſonably doubt whether he himſelf were ſatisfied with his own perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this. I have two great reaſons to think he was not. The firſt is, that it ſeems he never conſulted <hi>Philo</hi>'s Notions of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> before he made this Judgment, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93550:109"/> that he could not but ſee them in <hi>Grotius</hi> on St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, which he quotes; and he could not but know how much they were inſiſted upon by thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whom he pretended to anſwer. They do indeed ſo diſtinctly and clearly eſtabliſh the Perſonality of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they render uſeleſs and unſuitable all the Interpretations he has found out for the Texts in the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that he himſelf, though he fitted his Interpretations to divers paſſages in the <hi>Targum,</hi> thereby to break the force of them when turned againſt him, is yet forced to acknowledg, that ſometimes the word <hi>Memra</hi> ſignifies a Perſon properly ſo called, according to our ſenſe of it. The ſeveral places where the Word is ſaid to create the World, give him much trouble to elude them. And though he endeavours to rid his hands of them, by aſſerting the Word does there ſignifie the Power of God; nevertheleſs he lets you underſtand that if you are not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with that Solution, you may have his conſent to take it in the <hi>Arian</hi> ſenſe of the word, for a created God, by whom, as by a real and Inſtrumental cauſe, God did truly create the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>This is the ſtrangeſt anſwer that could be returned to ſo great an Objection. For he muſt have loſt his Reaſon, who imagins that God can make a Creature capable of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Univerſe. Grant this, and by what Character will you diſtinguiſh the Creature from the Creator? By what right then could God appropriate, as he doth very often in the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93550:110"/> Old Teſtament, the work of the World's Creation to himſelf, excluding any other from having to do in it but himſelf? Why ſhould God upon this ſcore forbid the giving worſhip to the Creature which is due to the Creator? The <hi>Arians</hi> who worſhip Jeſus Chriſt, though they eſteem him a Creature, and thoſe Papiſts who ſwallow whole the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantion; they may teach in their Schools that a Creature may be inab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God to become a Creator. But for us, who deny that any thing but God is to be adored, as <hi>Philo</hi> did before us, <hi>de Decal. p.</hi> 581. <hi>de Monarch. p.</hi> 628. We reject all ſuch vain conceits of a Creature being any way capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive the Infinite Power of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>There are other places alſo which he found he could not eaſily evade, ſo at length he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents that the <hi>Memra</hi> does often denote a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Language of the <hi>Targums;</hi> as where we read, the Word ſpake, and the Word ſaid. But what kind of Perſon? An Angel, a Created Angel in his Judgment, that ſpeaks in the Name of God. And thus he thinks the Word is to be underſtood in thoſe Paraphraſes, when they aſcribe to the Word the leading of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
               <p>The Reader may judge how many Texts this Anſwer will fit, by reviewing what has been ſaid in the two foregoing Chapters. He will find I have there prevented this Anſwer, and ſhewed that <hi>Philo</hi> and the <hi>Targums</hi> did not take this for a created Angel, but for a Divine Perſon; who was called an Angel in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93550:110"/> reſpect of the Office he diſcharged according to the Oeconomy between the three Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity; and of whom the <hi>Targums</hi> generally make expreſs mention in places where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text hath <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> or the Angel of the Lord; and ſometimes where it hath ſimply the Name <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, to leave no doubt in this matter, we will undertake to prove further, that the Word doth not ſignifie a Created Angel in <hi>Philo,</hi> or in the <hi>Targums,</hi> but a truly Divine Perſon.</p>
               <p>It is true, that <hi>Philo</hi> ſometimes calls the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Plural. But elſwhere he ſpeaks of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſingularly in terms that expreſs his acknowledgment of him for the Creator of Angels, and conſequently for God: This he does in his Book <hi>de Sacrif. Abel. p.</hi> 202. where he declares him to be the Word that appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates him from the Angels, which are the Hoſts of God.</p>
               <p>Again, he deſcribes the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> under the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as true God, as Creator of the World, <hi>Lib. de Temulentia, p.</hi> 190. <hi>D.</hi> 194. <hi>B.</hi> But the Angels after another manner, <hi>de Plant. Noae, p.</hi> 168. <hi>F. G. de Gigant. p.</hi> 221. <hi>E. de Mundo, p.</hi> 391.</p>
               <p>It is true, he calls the Word an Archangel, <hi>de Conf. Linguar. p.</hi> 267. <hi>B.</hi> But in the ſame place he calls him the firſt-born of God, the Image of God, the Creator of the World, <hi>p.</hi> 258. <hi>A.</hi> And in another place, the Son of God, that conducted <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Quis rer. Divin. Haeres, p.</hi> 397. <hi>F.G.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:93550:111"/>
               <p>He was ſo far from taking the Word to be an Angel, that he affirmed, the Word uſed to appear to Men under the form of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; thus ſaith he, the Word appeared to <hi>Jacob, de Somn. p.</hi> 465. <hi>D.</hi> And to <hi>Hagar, p.</hi> 466. <hi>B.</hi> We are to obſerve this carefully, that we may make <hi>Philo</hi> agree with <hi>Philo.</hi> For one while he ſaith an Angel appeared to the Patriarchs, and another time he ſaith the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> appeared to them; his deſign being to acquaint us that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is named an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, becauſe he appeared as an Angel in theſe kinds of Manifeſtations of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now as to the <hi>Targums,</hi> they likewiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by this Angel a Perſon that is truly God. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Could they aſcribe the Creation of the World to the Word, as they do, and yet think him to be a Creature? Could they profeſs him the Creator of Mankind, without aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Divinity? Could they think him to be no better than an Angel, and yet make him to be Worſhipped by Men, whom they know to be little lower than Angels? Could they imagin him to have given the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and not reflect on the Preface of the Law; wherein the great Law-giver ſays, I am <hi>Jehovah,</hi> thy God that brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt?</hi> The Word is not ſo often called an Angel in the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums,</hi> as he is ſet forth with theſe Characters of God; as the Reader may ſee eſpecially in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum,</hi> and in that of <hi>Jeruſalem, Exod.</hi> iii. 14. xii. 42. and in many other places.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:93550:111"/>2. The <hi>Targums</hi> always diſtinguiſh the Word from the Angels; repreſenting them as Meſſengers employed by the Word, as the Word himſelf is often deſcribed as God's Meſſenger. Thus the <hi>Targ.</hi> on 1 <hi>King.</hi> xix. 11, 12. on <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxviii. 13, 18. on 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxii. 21.</p>
               <p>They ſay the Word was attended with Angels, when he gave the Law, <hi>Targ.</hi> on 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 11. and when he aſſiſted at the Interment of <hi>Moſes. Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiv. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Targums</hi> repreſent the Word, as ſitting on a High Throne, and hearing the Prayers of the People. <hi>Jon.</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> iv. 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaith expreſly, that the Word that ſpake to <hi>Moſes,</hi> was the ſame who ſpake and the World was made, and who was God of <hi>Abraham, Exod.</hi> iii. 14, 15. vi. 4. So then if he who was the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was only an Angel that Perſonated God, then he who created the World was a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; which, as I have ſhewed, is abſurd.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is impoſſible to explain otherwiſe what the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo unanimouſly affirm, that God revealed himſelf face to face to <hi>Moſes;</hi> which is more than he granted any Prophet beſides, unleſs the Word that appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> was true God, and not a meer Angel. See <hi>Onk.</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiv. 10, 11. and the other <hi>Targums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what? ſay they, may not an Angel bear the Name of God, when he ſuſtains the Perſon of God? was not the Ark called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> becauſe it was a Symbol of his Perſon?</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:93550:112"/>
               <p>Does not <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> xi. 35, 36. ſay to the Ark, <hi>Revelare Sermo Domini &amp; redi?</hi> This is indeed a Notion which the <hi>Socinians</hi> have borrowed of <hi>Abenezra</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. and <hi>Joſeph. Albo de fund. c.</hi> 8. And ſo they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the Pillar of Cloud is called the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> xiii. 21. xiv. 19. that the Ark is called the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> x. 35. that the Angel is called the Lord, <hi>Judg.</hi> vi. 15. The Name being given to the Symbol, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ark; and to the ſecond Cauſe, namely, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; becauſe of their repreſenting God.</p>
               <p>But to the great diſpleaſure of our Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> that borrow their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, we have ſtill enough of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pieces left, to ſhew their quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Sentiments in theſe matters.</p>
               <p>For, 1. they (as has been already obſerved) believed that the Angel ſpoken of in <hi>Judg.</hi> vi. 15. was the Word; and that this Word created the World, as has been largely proved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Juſt the reverſe of what our Moderns ſay, did the Ancients hold, as we gather from <hi>Philo.</hi> For inſtead of an Angel's taking the place of God, he ſaith, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> took the place of an Angel. <hi>De Somn. p.</hi> 466.</p>
               <p>As to the Ark, it is folly to imagin that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God promiſed to dwell and to hear Prayers there, and enjoyned Worſhip toward it, therefore the Ark was called <hi>Jehovah.</hi> The ancient <hi>Jews</hi> ſpoke not to the Ark, but to God, who reſided between the Cherubims. This is plainly expreſſed in thoſe words of <hi>Jonathan, Numb.</hi> xi. 35, 36. <hi>Revelare Sermo
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93550:112"/> Domini, &amp;c.</hi> where the words are not addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Ark it ſelf, but to him that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give them ſome Tokens of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; namely to the Word, who created the World, who redeemed <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> who heard their Prayers over the Ark, and who had ſhut up therein the Tables of the Law, which he had given them on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Targum</hi> on 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xiii. 6. <hi>David and all Iſrael went up to remove the Ark of the Lord, that dwelleth between the Cherubims, whoſe Name is called on it;</hi> or as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vi. 2. <hi>Whoſe Name is called by the Name of the Lord of Hoſts, that dwelleth between the Cherubims.</hi> In ſhort, the Scripture never gives to any Place or Creature the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the <hi>Nominative</hi> Caſe, either ſingly, or joined with any other <hi>Noun</hi> in appoſition: But ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an <hi>Oblique</hi> Caſe, as <gap reason="foreign">

Hiſt. of the Ark, c.</hi> 1. And the Reader ſhall have a full Satisfaction upon it, out of the following Chapters.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore certain, That the <hi>Word</hi> mentioned in <hi>Philo</hi> and the Paraphraſes, is not an Angel, but a Divine Perſon; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Philo</hi> calls him many times; and if the Expreſſion be allowable, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But we muſt now go on to that which will remove all difficulties from this Subject, and convince the Reader, if any thing can do it, That the <hi>Jews</hi> looked upon the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as a Divine Perſon. I ſpeak of the Appearances of an Angel who is called God, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as God under the Old Teſtament: And I thought fit for this very reaſon to enlarge more upon this Subject, to prevent at once all the Objections of the New <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the <hi>Unitarians.</hi>

Whereas thoſe Old <hi>Jews</hi> who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tradition of their Forefathers, being not biaſſed by the Spirit of Diſpute, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it of the <hi>Cochma</hi> and <hi>Bina, viz.</hi> of the Wiſdom and of the Holy Ghoſt; as we were admoniſhed by <hi>R. Joſeph de Karnitol</hi> in his <hi>Saare Tſedec, fol.</hi> 25. <hi>col.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 26. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>This Collection of Commentators being of great uſe for the interpreting the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſeveral Divines that have applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Study of the Rabbins Comments, have been led by them unwarily into this Opinion. The renowned <hi>Grotius</hi> fell into this Snare, and has had but too many Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93550:114"/> We have no cauſe to wonder that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do the ſame, being concern'd, as they are, to find Examples in the Old Teſtament, of Religious Worſhip paid to Angels, the better to cover their Idolatry.</p>
               <p>But in truth, the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> do in this quite abandon the Ancient Sentiments of their Fathers: And they who follow the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Jews</hi> herein, do weaken (I hope, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking of it) the Proofs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Jeſus Chriſt, by yielding up to the Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> as an agreed Point between them and the Chriſtians, that which is quite contrary to what the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians ſuppoſed in their Diſputes with the <hi>Jews</hi> of their Times; and which our later <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves would never have ſubmitted to, if they had known any other way to avoid the Arguments that were brought againſt them out of their own Scriptures.</p>
               <p>It behoves us therefore to give their juſt Force to thoſe Arguments that were uſed by the Apoſtles and Fathers, and to recover to Truth all her Advantages, by ſhewing how bad Guides our Modern <hi>Jews</hi> are in the matters now before us; and how they have deviated from the conſtant Doctrine of their Anceſtors, to find out ways to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I affirm then for certain, That the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of God, or of any Angel that is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or that is worſhipp'd, ſpoken of in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were not referred by the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> to created Angels, who perſonated God. And further, I maintain, That generally the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93550:114"/> Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> referred theſe Appearances to the <hi>Word,</hi> whom they diſtinguiſh'd from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as they do God from the Creature; and thereby juſtified the Patriarchs in paying him that appeared to them Divine Worſhip and Adoration.</p>
               <p>To prove this, I muſt return to <hi>Philo</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which I have had occaſion to alledge in ſeveral places. I would willingly ſpare my ſelf the Trouble, and my Reader the Nauſeouſneſs of repeating the ſame things. But this is a matter of ſuch Importance, as neceſſarily obliges me, by a particular Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of Paſſages, to produce <hi>Philo</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Point, as I have done in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. He is indeed ſo ample, and ſo much ours in his Teſtimony concerning the Dignity of the Angel that appeared to the Fathers, as more he could not well be, if we had hired him to depoſe on our ſide.</p>
               <p>In general, he aſſerts, That it was the Word that appeared to <hi>Adam, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> although in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> it is only an Angel that is ſpoken of, [<hi>De Somn. p.</hi> 461.]</p>
               <p>It was the Word that appeared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> xviii. 1. according to <hi>Philo;</hi> for he ſaith, It was the Word that promiſed <hi>Sarah</hi> a Son in her Old Age, and that enabled her to conceive and bring forth, [<hi>Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Alleg. p.</hi> 77. <hi>E.</hi>]</p>

               <p n="2">II. Let us come next to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes, and ſee how they render thoſe Texts that ſpeak of the Divine Appearances in Scripture; and let the Reader take theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks along with him: 1. That whatſoever he finds in thoſe Paraphraſes, he may be aſſured that it was the General Senſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in Ancient Times. 2. That any Judicious Writer can juſtly ſuſpect thoſe who firſt publiſhed thoſe <hi>Targums,</hi> to have cut many parts of them, to favour the new Method of their laſt Writers, which I have explained in the beginning of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The firſt Appearance of God to Man was when having <hi>created</hi> our firſt Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 27. <hi>He bleſſed them, and ſaid unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and repleniſh the earth, Gen.</hi> i. 28. He that gave them this Bleſſing was he that created them, as we read in the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 27. <hi>The Word of the Lord created Man in his own Image.</hi> For his giving them the Bleſſing, we have it in that <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxv. 9. We have theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>O Eternal God, thou haſt taught
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93550:116"/> us the Marriage-bleſſing of Adam and his Wife; for thus the Scripture ſaith expreſly, And the Word of the Lord bleſſed them, and the Word of the Lord ſaid to them, Be ye fruitful, and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God appeared again to our firſt Parents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 8. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking in the midſt of the garden.</hi> Now as <hi>Philo</hi> ſaid to us, that it was the Word of the Lord that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo both <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> have it, that <hi>Adam</hi> and his Wife <hi>heard the Voice of the Word of the Lord God walking in the garden.</hi> Likewiſe in the <hi>Jeruſalem Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> ver. 9. it is ſaid, <hi>The Word of the Lord called to Adam, &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Where <hi>Adam</hi> makes this Anſwer to God, <hi>I heard thy Voice in the garden;</hi> both <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> have it, <hi>I heard the Voice of thy Word in the garden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Hiſtory of the Deluge, we ſee that there was a Revelation to <hi>Noah</hi> the Preacher of Righteouſneſs, to build the Ark, and to warn others while that was preparing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 20. But who gave <hi>Noah</hi> that warning? <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the Lord ſaid this by his Word.</hi> And the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum, It was the Word of the Lord that ſaid this.</hi> And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>Jonathan</hi> has it in <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 6. That the <hi>Lord judged them by his Word;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I will deſtroy them by my Word.</hi> Likewiſe for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> vii. 16. all the Paraphraſts attributed this to the Word: The <hi>Jeruſalem Targum</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Word of the Lord ſpared Noah.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> viii. 1. <hi>Jonathan</hi> has it, That <hi>the Word of the Lord remembred Noah.</hi> Laſtly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93550:116"/> to <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, The Lord ſaid by his Word, I will not again curſe the ground any more for man's ſake,</hi> Gen. viii. 21.</p>
               <p>After the Flood, God appeared often to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now according to <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> xv. 6. a Promiſe being made unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that his Seed ſhould be as the Stars of Heaven for Number, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>believing in the Word of the Lord,</hi> was accounted to him for Righteouſneſs: Therefore it was the <hi>Word of the Lord</hi> that came to him in a Viſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and that made him that Promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. It followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. that he ſaid to <hi>Abraham, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees.</hi> Who ſaid this to <hi>Abraham?</hi> Even the Word of the Lord, according to <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>'s <hi>Targum;</hi> for there is no other Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Caſe of the Verb in his Paraphraſe. You ſee the ſame upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s dividing the Beaſts, in order to his making a Covenant with God; it was done at God's Command, who thereupon did appear between the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and did ſolemnly enter into a Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> xv. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now ſaith the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Paraphraſe on <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 42. It was <hi>the Word of the Lord that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> between the Pieces. And according to <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, Exod.</hi> vi. 8. It was <hi>by his Word</hi> that God made this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt take notice that he that appeared then to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaith, I am <hi>El Shaddai,</hi> which is here tranſlated, <hi>The Almighty God:</hi> For according to <hi>Onkelos</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 25. in the Bleſſing of <hi>Jacob</hi> to his Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> theſe Names, The <hi>Word of God,</hi> and <hi>El Shaddai,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:93550:117"/> are of the ſame Extent: Thus it runs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Onkelos, The Word of the God of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall help thee; and El Shaddai ſhall bleſs thee:</hi> Where plainly <hi>El Shaddai</hi> is the ſame that is called, <hi>The Word of the God of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Philo</hi> taught us that the Appearance of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> xviii. 1. was an Appearance of the Word, <hi>Alleg.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 77. <hi>E.</hi> where he calls one of the Three Angels that appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the Word of God; and <hi>Joſephus L.</hi> 1. <hi>Ant. c.</hi> 12. calls him God: So the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe has it in the end of the next Verſe; <hi>The Word of the Lord appeared to Abraham in the Valley of Viſion, as he ſat warming himſelf in the Sun, becauſe of his Circumciſion.</hi> Elſewhere the ſame Paraphraſe quotes theſe Words as being the Words of Scripture; ſaying on <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxv. 9. <hi>The Scripture hath declared, and ſaid, And the Word of the Lord appeared to him in the Valley of Viſion. Jonathan</hi> alſo in his Paraphraſe on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiv. 6. hath theſe words, The Lord hath taught us to viſit the Sick, in that <hi>he revealed himſelf by the Viſion of his Word to Abraham,</hi> when he was ſick of the cutting of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>When God gave him a Command for the ſacrificing of his Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2. then, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was doing it, the Angel of the Lord called to him out of Heaven, and told him, <hi>Now I know thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy Son, thine only Son from ME.</hi> This laſt word plainly ſheweth that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel was God himſelf, even the ſame that ſpake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and gave him that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

                  </gap>, the Word, according to <hi>Philo,</hi> as it has been already ſhewn. The <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Paraphraſe hath the ſame on <hi>ver.</hi> 8. where, upon <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s enquiring for the Lamb that was to be ſacrificed, <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwereth him, <hi>My Son, the Word of the Lord will prepare me a ſheep.</hi> And ſo when <hi>Abraham</hi> found that the Word did provide him a Sheep, and accepted of that for a Sacrifice inſtead of his Son, <hi>Abraham worſhipped, and pray'd to the Word of the Lord,</hi> ſaying (among many other things), <hi>Thou, O Lord, didſt ſpeak to me, that I ſhould offer up Iſaac my Son.</hi> In the other <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums, ver.</hi> 16, 17. where the Angel of the Lord calls to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of Heaven <hi>the ſecond time</hi> (which laſt word ſheweth that this Angel was God himſelf, for it was God that called to him out of Heaven <hi>the firſt time,</hi> as it has been already ſhewn), and ſaith to <hi>Abraham, By my ſelf I have ſworn, ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not withheld thine only ſon from me,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Amongſt the Divine Appearances to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> thoſe two at <hi>Bethel</hi> were more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the reſt; one at his going to <hi>Padan-Aram, Gen.</hi> xxviii. 13. the other at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93550:119"/> from thence, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxv. 9. where it is ſaid expreſly, that <hi>then God appeared to him the ſecond time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of the firſt of theſe is given us at large, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 13,—16. <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf gives this account of the laſt to his Son <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Gen.</hi> xlviii. 3, 4. <hi>God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and bleſſed me, and ſaid unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and multiply thee,</hi> &amp;c. That it was the Word that appeared to him, we have ſhewn already from <hi>Philo</hi> in ſeveral places; and that this was the Senſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in his time, we have reaſon to believe: For as to this firſt Appearance; in the Introduction, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. where the Text ſpeaks of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſetting out from <hi>Beerſheba</hi> to go to <hi>Haran,</hi> there both <hi>Jonathan</hi> and the <hi>Jeruſalem Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> tell us of the Sun's making haſte to go down before his time, becauſe the Word had a deſire to ſpeak with <hi>Jacob.</hi> Again, in the Concluſion of this Hiſtory, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 20, 21. Where <hi>Jacob</hi> vowed a Vow, ſaying, If God will be with me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then ſhall the Lord be my God: Here we read in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> That <hi>Jacob vowed a Vow to the Word, ſaying, If the Word of the Lord will be my help,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> Why ſhould the Paraphraſt ſay, That <hi>Jacob</hi> made this Vow to the Word; and not rather, to God, as it is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text; but that they believed that it was <hi>the Word</hi> that appeared to him? And this being ſo, we cannot be to ſeek who that Angel was that ſpake to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> xxxi. 11. for he declares, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>I am the God of Bethel—where thou vowedſt a Vow unto
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93550:119"/> me.</hi> We ſee in the <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 20. That it was the Word to whom <hi>Jacob</hi> vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Vow at <hi>Bethel;</hi> therefore according to this <hi>Targum</hi> it muſt be the Word that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Angel in the place next before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>The ſecond time that God appeared to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was in his Return from <hi>Padan-Aram, Gen.</hi> xxxv. 9. and it is expreſly ſaid in the <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> Targum, <hi>The Word of the Lord appeared to Jacob the ſecond time, when he was coming from Padan-Aram, and bleſſed him;</hi> which is as clear a Teſtimony as can be deſired for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever will reflect with ſome attention upon thoſe Appearances of God to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and compare them with what we read <hi>Gen.</hi> xlviii. 15, 16. and with what <hi>Hoſea</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>ch.</hi> xii. concerning the Angel who was God, could not but take notice of two things: The firſt is, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is call'd an Angel was God indeed. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that the wreſtling of that Angel with <hi>Jacob</hi> was a preparation for the belief of the Myſtery of the Incarnation by which the Apoſtles were made able to ſay, which <hi>we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of Life, this is our Meſſage,</hi> 1 Joh. i. 1.5. But we muſt go on upon ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Subject.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> 
               </head>
               <head type="sub">That all the Appearances of God, or of the Angel of the Lord, which are ſpoken of in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, have been referred to the Word of God by the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</head>
               <p>WE read of no other Appearance of God, or of an Angel of the Lord, till that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw on Mount <hi>Horeb, Exod.</hi> iii. 2. There we read that <hi>the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midſt of a Buſh.</hi> This is the only place where <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth him an Angel that now appeared. Elſwhere he always calleth him God, as particularly <hi>v.</hi> 4. where he ſaith that upon his turning aſide to ſee why the Buſh was not burnt, <hi>When the Lord ſaw this, God called to him out of the midſt of the Buſh, and ſaid to him, I am the God of thy Father, the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob, v.</hi> 6. whereupon <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that <hi>he hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.</hi> After this he goeth on ſtill call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him God, as we read almoſt in every verſe; ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 16. He ſaith God commanded him to go to the Elders of <hi>Iſrael, and ſay to them, The Lord God of your Fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob, appeared to me.</hi> God would not have him tell them that which was not true, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93550:120"/> therefore we may be ſure that it was not a Created Angel, but God that appeared to him. But why then ſhould <hi>Moſes</hi> once call him an Angel? as we ſee he did in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe. A created Angel he could not be, for the reaſons now mentioned; he muſt therefore be God, and yet he muſt appear as an Angel that came on a Meſſage from God. This is what <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith in one word, He was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Word, who is both God, and the Meſſenger of God, as we have ſhewn from him in ſeveral places.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Targums</hi> the matter is clear, for when <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to tell them that their God had appeared to him, and ſent him to bring them forth out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that <hi>Moſes</hi> askt him his Name; and that God ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> tell them, <hi>I AM THAT I AM,</hi> or in fewer words ſay, <hi>I AM, has ſent me unto you;</hi> that which here God calls himſelf, is the ſenſe of the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that ſignifieth the Eternal Being. Now ſee how this is rendred in the <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> Targum. There we read, that <hi>the Word of the Lord ſaid to Moſes, He that ſaid to the World, let it be, and it was, and ſhall ſay, Let it be, and it ſhall be.</hi> Here <hi>Moſes</hi> askt God, and the Word anſwereth his queſtion. But certain it is, that he that anſwered the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the ſame that he had been ſpeaking with all this while; even the ſame that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in the Buſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> being thus employ'd by the Word of God, as his Meſſenger to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the diſcharge of his Miniſtry, had both his Inſtructions and Credentials from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93550:121"/> the Word, according to the <hi>Targums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, God appeared to him oftener than to any before him. <hi>R. Akiba,</hi> who lived ſince Chriſt's time, ſaith that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> acted as Mediator between the <hi>Gevura,</hi> that is, the Word of God, and the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and obſerveth, that God ſpake to him 175 times. They were times without number that God ſpake to him, from off the Mercy-ſeat, upon the Ark of Teſtimony, from between the two Cherubims, <hi>Numb.</hi> vii. 89. But thoſe which <hi>R. Akiba</hi> reckons, were Appearances upon extraordinary occaſions. In both theſe Appearances ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, it was the Word of God that ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> according to the <hi>Targums;</hi> Thus of God's ſpeaking to him from the Mercy-ſeat to appoint my Word for thee, as God promiſed there according to <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxv. 22. xxx. 36. So <hi>Numb.</hi> vii. 89. <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaith <hi>it was the Word that ſpake to him.</hi> And thus likewiſe in thoſe Occaſional Appearances, both <hi>Jonathan</hi> and the <hi>Jeruſalem Targums</hi> tell us, once for all, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiv. 10. <hi>The Word of the Lord knew Moſes</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſpeaking to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> as oft as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to him on any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For his Credentials were as we ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiv. 11. All the Signs and Wonders which the Lord ſent him to do, or according to the <hi>Targums</hi> which <hi>the Word of the Lord ſent him to do, in Egypt, to Pharaoh, and his Servants, and all his Land; and in all that mighty Land, and that great terrour, which Moſes ſhewed in the ſight of all Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:93550:121"/>
               <p>For the Acts of his Miniſtry, they were chiefly theſe three: 1. His bringing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> 2. His giving them Laws and Statutes, and Judgments from God. 3. His Leading them through the Wilderneſs to the Confines of <hi>Canaan.</hi> In each of theſe was the Word that appeared to him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Targums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His bringing the People out of <hi>Egypt</hi> is wholly aſcribed to the Word, by <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> xx. 1. and by <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxiv. 18. The People were commanded to teach this to their Children, that it was <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi> that did all thoſe Signs and Wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xiii. 8. It was the Word that ſent all thoſe Plagues on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Servants, and all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxviii. 6. and xxix. 2. Eſpecially, it was the Word that gave that ſtroke which finiſht the work, according to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 29. namely, It was <hi>the Word of the Lord that appeared againſt the Egyptians at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; and his right hand kill'd the firſt-born of the Egyptians, and delivered his own firſt-born the Children of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the Word of the Lord led the People through the Deſert to the Red-Sea, ſaith the ſame <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xiii. 18. The Word of the Lord being their Leader, in a Pillar of Fire by night, and of a Cloud by day, ſaith <hi>Onkelos</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> i. 32, 33. And when the People being come to the Red-Sea, and ſeeing <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his Army behind them, were in a rage againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he cried to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> xiv. 15. according to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93550:122"/> the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>the Word of the Lord ſaid to Moſes,</hi> How long doſt thou ſtand and pray before me?—Bid the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> come forward, and do thou reach out thy Rod, and divide the Red Sea; He did ſo, and according to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum on <hi>Deut.</hi> i. 1. <hi>The Word divided the Sea</hi> before them. So that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went into the midſt of the Sea on dry ground, <hi>Exod.</hi> xiv. 22. the <hi>Egyptians</hi> following them. And at morning, <hi>v.</hi> 24. according to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>The Word of the Lord lookt upon the Army of the Egyptians,</hi> and threw upon them <hi>Bitumen,</hi> and Fire, and Hail out of Heaven; and <hi>v.</hi> 25. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaid, Let us fly from before the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for <hi>this is the Word of the Lord that gets them victory;</hi> But their flight was in vain, for <hi>by the Word of the Lord, the waters were made heaps,</hi> according to <hi>Onkelos</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xv. 8. And according to him alſo, when <hi>God ſpoke by his Word, the Sea covered them, v.</hi> 10. Thus, as the whole work of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo every part of it, has been aſcribed to the Word of the Lord by the <hi>Targums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the giving of the Laws, by which they were to be formed into a Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Firſt, immediately after their coming out of the Red-Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> xv. 25. according to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>the Word of the Lord gave them Precepts and Orders of Judgments;</hi> particularly, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> has it, <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi> gave them there the Law of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and that of Honouring Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Judgments concerning Bruiſes and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93550:122"/> Wounds, and for the Puniſhment of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours. Afterwards, when they were come into the Wilderneſs of <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> xix. 3. the Text ſaith, <hi>Moſes</hi> went up to God, and the Lord called to him out of the Mount, ſaying, <hi>Thus ſhalt thou ſay to the Houſe of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> there <hi>Onkelos</hi> ſaith, according to one of <hi>Clark</hi>'s various Readings, <hi>Moſes went up to meet the Word of the Lord, Exod.</hi> xix. 8. <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with the People's Anſwer to the Lord, then, <hi>v.</hi> 9. according to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, <hi>the Word of the Lord ſaid to Moſes,</hi> Go to the People, and ſanctifie them to day and to morrow, and let them waſh their Clothes, and be ready againſt the third day, for the third day the Lord will come down in the ſight of all the People upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the People having prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on the third day, according to <hi>Onke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, Exod.</hi> xix. 17. <hi>Moſes brought the People out of the Camp to meet the word of God;</hi> Yet the People only ſaw Thunder and Lightning, and the Mountain ſmoking, and felt the Earth quake under them: They alſo heard the noiſe of the Trumpet, which ſo affrighted them, that they removed and ſtood at a diſtance, and ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Speak thou to us, and we will hear, but <hi>let not the Word from before the Lord ſpeak with us, leſt we die,</hi> Exod. xx. 19. according to <hi>Onkelos,</hi> in one of <hi>Clark</hi>'s various Readings. <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore according to <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 5. <hi>Stood between them and the Word of the Lord,</hi> to ſhew them the <hi>Pithgama,</hi> the matter and words that were ſpoken to him from the Lord. What they were, we read <hi>Exod.</hi> xx. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93550:123"/> to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>the Word of the Lord ſpoke</hi> the tenor of all theſe words, ſaying, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> which brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the Houſe of Bondage; then follow the Ten Commandments, commonly called the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</hi> That it was God the Word that ſpoke this to the People, the ancient Church could not doubt, as we ſee in the Book of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> where <hi>Jonathan</hi> tells us, that thus <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> minded his People of what they had heard and ſeen at the giving of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> iv. 33. <hi>Is it poſſible that a People ſhould have heard the voice of the Word of the Lord, the Living God, ſpeak out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and yet live?</hi> Again, <hi>v.</hi> 36. <hi>Out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he hath made you hear the voice of his Word, —and ye have heard his words out of the midſt of the fire.</hi> Again, he puts them in mind of the fright they were in, <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 23. <hi>After ye had heard the voice of the Word out of the midſt of the Darkneſs on the Mount burning with fire, all the Chiefs of you came to me, and ſaid, Behold the Word of the Lord our God has ſhewed us the Divine Majeſty of his Glory, and the Excellence of his Magnificence, and we have heard the voice of his Word out of the midſt of the fire, why ſhould we die? as we muſt, if we hear any more of the voice of the Word of the Lord our God;</hi> for <hi>who is there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in fleſh, that hears the voice of the Word of the Living God ſpeaking out of the middle of the fire, as we do, and yet live?</hi> Again, <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 16. he minds them of the ſame thing in ſome of the ſame Words. Many more ſuch Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations might be added, but theſe are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to prove that it was the undoubted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93550:123"/> Tradition of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, That their Law was given by the Word of God, and that it was he that appeared to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As the Word gave the Law, it was he that made thoſe many Appearances to <hi>Moſes</hi> throughout his whole Conduct of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>To begin with that Divine Appearance, which was continually in ſight of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for forty years together through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole Travel in the Wilderneſs; namely, the Pillar which they ſaw in the Air day and night. Where this Pillar is firſt ſpoken of, namely, at the coming of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there it is expreſly ſaid, That <hi>the Lord went before them in the Pillar of Cloud by day, and fire by night, Exod.</hi> xiii. 21. Afterward indeed he is called the Angel of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> xiv. 19. where we read that the People being come to the Red-Sea, and being there in imminent danger of being overtaken by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by whom they were cloſely purſued, the Angel which had gone before the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> all day, removed at night, and went behind them.— That this Angel was God, it is certain, not only becauſe he is called God, <hi>Exod.</hi> xiii. 21. xiv. 24. <hi>Numb.</hi> xii. 5. But alſo becauſe he was Worſhipped, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiii. 10. which was a ſure Proof of his Divinity. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God himſelf, and yet the Meſſenger of God, it muſt be that this was the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or Word; and that this was the Tradition of the ancient Church, we are taught not only by <hi>Philo</hi> in the place above mentioned,<note place="margin">Quis rer. Div. haeres: p. <hi>397.</hi> F.G.</note> but

               <p>When, <hi>Exod.</hi> xvii. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Amalekites</hi> came againſt this poor people that had never ſeen War; and ſmote the hindmoſt of them, God not only gave his people a Victory over them, but alſo ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> write this for a Memorial in a Book,—That <hi>I will utterly put out the Remembrance of Amalek from under Heaven, Exod.</hi> xvii. 14. See how <hi>Moſes</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms this, <hi>v.</hi> 15. In the place where they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93550:124"/> had fought he ſet up an Altar inſcribed, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah Niſſi, The Lord is my Standard;</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was the will of God they ſhould be in perpetual War againſt <hi>Amalek;</hi> and this reaſon for it he entreth in his Book, <hi>v.</hi> 16. according to <hi>Jonathan, for the Word of the Lord has ſworn by his Glory, that he will have war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Amalek for all Generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Divine Appearance we read of, was at the giving of the Law on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai;</hi> whereof enough has been already ſaid, and we muſt avoid being too long. For which reaſon we omit much more that might be ſaid of the following Appearances in the Wilderneſs, which are all aſcribed to the Word in one or other of the <hi>Targums.</hi> But I ought not to omit to take notice of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial things.</p>
               <p>So for their places of Worſhip, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed according to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>Exod.</hi> xx. 24. Whereſoever you ſhall mention my Holy Name, <hi>my Word ſhall appear to you, and ſhall bleſs you;</hi> and the Temple is called, <hi>the place which the Word of the Lord your God will chuſe to place his Shekinah there,</hi> according to <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s and the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targums on <hi>Deut.</hi> xii. 4. Eſpecially at the Altar for Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was before the Door of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, God promiſed <hi>Moſes,</hi> both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the People, according to <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxix. 42. <hi>I will appoint my Word to ſpeak with thee there, and I will appoint my Word there for the Children of Iſrael.</hi> Above all, at the Mercy-ſeat, where the Ark ſtood, God promiſed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to thoſe <hi>Targums</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxv. 22. xxx. 36. <hi>Numb.</hi> xxvii.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93550:125"/> 4. <hi>I will appoint my Word to ſpeak with thee there.</hi> And in ſum, of all the Precepts in <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> it is ſaid at the end of that Book, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe <hi>Targums</hi> on <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvi. 46. <hi>Theſe are the Statutes, and Judgments, and Laws which the Lord made between his Word and the Children of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they entred into Covenant with God, obliging themſelves to live according to his Laws; Hereby they made the Word to be their King, and themſelves his Subjects. So <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvi. 17. according to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>You have made the Word of the Lord King over you this day, that he may be your Glory.</hi> And v. 18. <hi>The VVord of the Lord is become King over you in his own Name, as over his beloved and peculiar people.</hi> In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence hereof, as being their King, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them by his chief Miniſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> to make him a Royal Pavilion or Tabernacle, and to ſet it up in the midſt of their Camp. Both that, and all the furniture of it, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Moſes</hi> to make according to the Pattern ſhow'd him in the Mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxv. 40. Eſpecially for the Preſence of the great King, there muſt be an Apartment in the inner part of the Tabernacle ſeparated from the reſt with a Veil Embroidered with Cherubims, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxvii. 31. which part was called the Moſt Holy Place, or the <hi>Holy of Holies, Exod.</hi> xxvi. 33. There was to be placed the Ark overlay'd with pure Gold, and having a Crown of Gold round about it. In the Ark were contain'd the Tables of the Law. Upon it was placed the Mercy-ſeat, overſhadowed with the Wings of two Cherubims that ſtood
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93550:125"/> on the two Ends of the Mercy-ſeat, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxvii. 9. looking each of them toward the other, and both of them toward the Mercy-ſeat. This Proviſion being made for the place of his <hi>Shekinah,</hi> the Word, which ſhewed it ſelf before in a Pillar of Cloud by day, and fire by night, that ſtood over the Camp; now from thence came to take poſſeſſion of his Royal Seat in the Tabernacle over the Ark; from whence, out of the void ſpace between theſe Cherubims, it was, that the Word uſed to ſpeak to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to give him Orders from time to time for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his People, according to the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxv. 22. xxx. 36. <hi>Numb.</hi> xvii. 4. and eſpecially <hi>Numb.</hi> vii. 8, 9. as has been above mentioned. Henceforward, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole Journey through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Pillar was conſtantly over the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and the People attended his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But whenſoever he gave the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the Pillar removed, and ſhewed which way the Camp was to go. Upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that, then <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt gave the word, in a ſet form of Prayer, which we have in the firſt ſix verſes of the lxviii <hi>Pſalm.</hi> The firſt verſe of it is <hi>Numb.</hi> x. 35. in theſe words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>Ariſe now Oh Word of the Lord in the might of thy ſtrength.</hi> According to <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Paraphraſe, <hi>Appear now Oh Word of the Lord in the ſtrength of thy wrath.</hi> In both the <hi>Targums</hi> it followeth, as in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, <hi>and the enemies of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be ſcattered, and they that hate thee ſhall flee before thee.</hi> When they had performed their Journey according to the will of their King,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93550:126"/> which they knew by ſeeing the Pillar ſtand ſtill, then <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed the Form for the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ark, <hi>Numb.</hi> x. 36. according to the forementioned Targums, <hi>Return now Oh Word of the Lord to thy people Iſrael, make the Glory of thy Shekinah dwell among them, and have mercy on the Thouſands of Iſrael.</hi> This being ſaid, the Prieſts (who carried the ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ins of the Tabernacle) took down their Burdens, and ſet up all things as before; and the Pillar returned to its place over the midſt of the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>In this State of <hi>Theocracy,</hi> their keeping of God's Laws is called by their Targums, <hi>The believing and obeying of the Word;</hi> their breaches of his Laws are called, <hi>their deſpiſing and rebell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Word.</hi> Of the uſe of both theſe manners of ſpeaking there might be given more inſtances than can be eaſily num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Targums</hi> likewiſe aſcribe to the Word both the rewarding of their Obedience, and the puniſhing of their Tranſgreſſions. On their Obedience, according to the <hi>Targums,</hi> it was the uſual promiſe, that <hi>the Word ſhould be their help or ſupport, Numb.</hi> xxiii. 8, 21. that <hi>he ſhould bleſs them and multiply them, Deut.</hi> xxiv. 19. that <hi>he ſhould rejoice over them to do them good, Deut.</hi> xxviii. 63. xxx. 9. They were told that <hi>he would be a conſuming fire to their enemies, Deut.</hi> iv. 24. particularly, that he was ſo to the <hi>Anakims, Deut.</hi> ix. 3. <hi>That it was he that delivered Og into their hands, Deut.</hi> iii. 2. <hi>That it was he that would caſt out all the Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, Deut.</hi> xi. 22.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:93550:126"/>
               <p>On the other hand, according to the ſenſe of the ancient Church, it was the Word that puniſhed them for their diſobedience, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it was he that forgave them upon their Repentance. Of both theſe kinds there are many remarkable inſtances, as particularly, of the puniſhing of their diſobedience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Jonathan</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxii. 35. It was <hi>the Word</hi> that <hi>deſtroyed the people for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Calf that Aaron made.</hi> For their luſting at <hi>Kibroth-hattaava, Moſes</hi> told them whom they provoked by it, <hi>Numb.</hi> xi. 20. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, You have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Word of the Lord, whoſe Shekinah dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth among you.</hi> Their refuſing to go forward toward the promiſed Land upon the Spies evil report of it, <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, according to thoſe Targums, <hi>Deut.</hi> i. 26. It was <hi>rebell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Word of the Lord.</hi> Afterward, when they would go up contrary to order, <hi>Numb.</hi> xiv. 41. <hi>Moſes</hi> asks them, <hi>Why do you tranſgreſs the decree of the Word of the Lord?</hi> In their murmuring at <hi>Zalmona,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Polyglot.</hi> Vol. IV.</note> 
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> xxi. 5. according to <hi>Onkelos</hi> in one of <hi>Clerk</hi>'s various Readings, <hi>They ſpoke againſt the Word of the Lord, and againſt Moſes.</hi> Wherefore v. 6. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>The Word of the Lord ſent fiery Serpents among the People.</hi> Upon their Whoring with <hi>Baal-Peor, Numb.</hi> xxv. 4. according to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>The Word of the Lord ſaid to Moſes, take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord.</hi> In ſhort, according to the <hi>Targums</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxviii. 20, 21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi> that would ſend all his Judgments and Curſes that are there denounced againſt impenitent Sinners.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:93550:127"/>
               <p>But on the other hand, according to thoſe Targums, <hi>the Word had</hi> the diſpencing of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to them that were Qualified for it. So when <hi>Moſes</hi> beg'd pardon for his People that had ſinned beyond mercy, if it had not been infinite, <hi>Numb.</hi> xiv. 20. according to the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> Targum, <hi>the Word of the Lord anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and ſaid, behold I have forgiven, and pardoned according to thy word.</hi> And in caſe, upon the inflicting of God's Judgments above mentioned, God's People ſhould be thereby brought to repentance; It was promiſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxx. 3. according to <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, <hi>that then the Word ſhould accept their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance according to his good pleaſure, and ſhould have mercy on them, and gather them out of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>c.</hi> xxxii. 36. according to the ſame <hi>Targum,</hi> it is promiſed that <hi>the Word of the Lord by his mercy ſhould judge the judgment of his people, and ſhould repent him of the evil that he had decreed againſt his Servants.</hi> It were eaſie to add many more ſuch Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of the <hi>Targums,</hi> but theſe are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough to ſhew the ſenſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, what they thought of him that ſo often appeared to their Fathers in the Wilderneſs, and ſpoke to them by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> underſtood that God was not willing he ſhould live to bring his People into the Promiſed Land; thereupon he beſought God to ſend him a Succeſſor, in theſe words, according to <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum, Numb.</hi> xxvii. 16. <hi>Let the Word of the Lord, who has dominion over the ſouls of men,—appoint a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man over the Congregation of his People.</hi> God
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93550:127"/> having appointed <hi>Joſhua</hi> in his ſtead, <hi>Moſes</hi> gave him this Charge in the hearing of the People, <hi>Deut.</hi> iii. 21, 22. according to <hi>Onke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, Thy eyes have ſeen what the Lord hath done to Og and Sihon, ſo ſhall he do to all the kingdoms where thou art to paſs; therefore fear them not, for the Word of the Lord your God ſhall fight for you.</hi> The ſame he repeated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to all the People, telling them firſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxi. 2, 3. according to <hi>Jonathan, The Word of the Lord hath ſaid to me, Thou ſhalt not paſs over this Jordan,</hi> but the Lord your God, <hi>and his Shekinah will go before you,</hi> Joſh. iv. He addeth, <hi>And Joſhua will go over before you,</hi> as the Lord has ſpoken: And for all your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>The Word of the Lord ſhall deliver them up before you;</hi> therefore ſaith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. according to <hi>Onkelos, Fear them not, for the Word of the Lord your God goes before you;</hi> he will not fail nor forſake you. After this he calleth to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and ſaith to him before them all, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. according to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> Be ſtrong and of a good Courage, for thou muſt go with this People into <hi>the Land which the Word of the Lord has ſworn to their Fathers that he would give them— and the Shekinah of the Word of the Lord ſhall go before thee, and his Word ſhall be thy help; he will not leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee;</hi> fear not therefore, neither be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd. He repeats it again from God to <hi>Joſhua, ver.</hi> 23. according to <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi> Thou ſhalt bring the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> into the Land which I have ſworn to them, and <hi>my Word ſhall be thy help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the ſame day, that together with this Charge, <hi>Moſes</hi> gave to <hi>Joſhua</hi> his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

God bade him <hi>Get thee up into Mount Nebo, and dye:</hi> After which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtaid no longer than to give the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Bleſſing before his Death, xxxiii. 1. That being done, he went up to Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> xxxiv. 1. There, according to <hi>Jonathan, It was the Word of the Lord</hi> that gave that Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Bodily Eyes, to ſee all the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> before they were cloſed: So <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of the Lord died there— <hi>according to the Word of the Lord.</hi> He was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated by the <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>After his Death, <hi>Joſhua</hi> entred into the Government, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and according to the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum,</hi> the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and they did <hi>as the Word of the Lord had</hi> commanded <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe Divine Appearances to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome few that were made to <hi>Balaam</hi> on their account, and are therefore recorded in the ſame Sacred Hiſtory. Where theſe are firſt mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxii. 9. both <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> have, That <hi>the Word came from before the Lord to Balaam, and ſaid</hi> what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in that place. So again the ſecond time, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. according to the ſame <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums, The Word came from before the Lord to Balaam by night, and ſaid</hi> to him what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93550:128"/> in that ſecond place. It is plain that ſo far the Ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church took theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to have been made by the Word.</p>
               <p>But what Opinion had they of the <hi>Angel</hi>'s appearing to <hi>Balaam, ver.</hi> 22.? Others may ask what they thought of the Dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Balaam</hi> and the Aſs that he rode upon, occaſioned by the Fright that the Beaſt was in at the Angel's appearing to him. All this, as <hi>Maimonides</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bochim <hi>11.</hi> p. <hi>42.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith, happened only in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Prophecy: But that it was a thing that really happened, we are aſſured by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 16. <hi>God open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mouth of the dumb beaſt to rebuke the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Prophet.</hi> As it cannot be doubted that <hi>Balaam</hi> was uſed to have Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Devils that ſpake to him in divers manners; ſo there is reaſon to believe they ſpoke to him ſometimes by the mouth of dumb Beaſts; and if ſo, then to hear the Aſs ſpeak could not be ſtrange to him. And why God ſhould order it ſo, there is a reaſon in <hi>Jonathan</hi> and the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum:</hi> The Reader may ſee other Reaſons elſewhere<note n="†" place="margin">Muis Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, p. <hi>95.</hi>
                  </note>, but they are not proper for this place. But we are here to conſider, whether this that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Balaam</hi> was a created Angel or no. It appears by the words, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. to have been the Lord himſelf that appeared as an Angel to <hi>Balaam;</hi> for thus he ſaith to him, <hi>Go with the men, but only the word that I ſhall ſpeak to thee, that thou ſhalt ſpeak.</hi> Now it doth not appear after this, that any other ſpoke to him from God, but God himſelf. Therefore <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith plainly, that this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was of the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93550:129"/> ſhown. And that this was the Senſe of the Church in his Age, we may ſee in the two following Appearances to <hi>Balaam;</hi> where as well as in the two that were before this, the <hi>Targums</hi> ſay, It was <hi>the Word that met Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, and ſpoke to him.</hi> Thus both <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> on <hi>Num.</hi> xxiii. 4, and 16.</p>

               <head type="sub">That all the Appearances of God or of the Angel of the Lord, which are ſpoken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moſes</hi> his time in the Books of the Old Teſtament, have been referred to the Word of God by the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt's Incarnation.</head>
               <p>THUS far it has been our buſineſs to ſhew, that it was the Word that made all thoſe Appearances, either of God, or of an Angel of God that was worſhipt, in any part of the five Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> We have been much larger in this than was neceſſary for our preſent occaſion. But whatſoever may ſeem to have been too much in this Chapter, it is hoped the Reader will not wiſh it had been ſpared, when he comes to reflect upon the uſe of it, to prove that the Word was a Perſon, and that he was God. At preſent there will be ſome kind of amends for the prolixity hitherto, in the ſhortneſs of what we have to ſay in the following part of this Chapter. For being now to treat of thoſe Divine Appearances that are recorded in the other Books of Scripture after the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi> we ſhall find thoſe Appearances few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and fewer, till they come quite to ceaſe in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.

And of thoſe Books of Scripture in which the following Appearances are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we have not ſo many Paraphraſes as we have of the five Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> One Paraphraſe is all that we have of moſt of the Books we now ſpeak of. But after all, we have reaſon to thank God, that that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Divine Appearances of the Word of God has been ſo abundantly ſufficient, that we have no need of any more. So that of the following Appearances of God, or of a Worſhipt Angel, it will be enough to ſhew that the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had the ſame Notion that they had of thoſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned out of the five Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read but of one Divine appearance to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and that is of one that came to him as <hi>a man with a drawn-ſword in his hand,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf <hi>the Captain of the Lord's Hoſt,</hi> Joſh. v. 13, 14.

Nor would a created Angel have taken it of him without giving him a preſent reproof, as the Angel did to St. <hi>John</hi> in the like Caſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> xix. 10. xxii. 9. But this Divine Perſon was ſo far from reproving him for having done too much, that he commanded him to go on, and do yet much more, requiring of him the higheſt acknowledgment of a Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence that was uſed among the Eaſtern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in theſe words, <hi>Looſe thy Shoo from off thy foot, for the ground whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy.</hi> Now conſidering that theſe are the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93550:130"/> very ſame words that God uſed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 2, 3. We ſee a plain reaſon why God ſhould command this to <hi>Joſhua.</hi> It was for the ſtrengthening of his faith, to let him know that, as he was now in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſtead, ſo God would be the ſame to him that he had been to <hi>Moſes.</hi> And particularly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that trial which required a more than ordinary meaſure of faith, the difficulty of taking the ſtrong City of <hi>Jericho</hi> with ſuch an Army as he had, without any proviſion for a Siege, the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> vi. 2. <hi>See I have given Jericho into thy hand.</hi> None but God could ſay and do this; and the Text plainly ſaith, <hi>It was the Lord.</hi> And that the Lord who thus appeared as a Warrier, and called himſelf <hi>Captain of the Lord's Hoſt,</hi> was no other than the Word, this was plainly the ſenſe of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; as appears by what remains of it in their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe on <hi>Joſh.</hi> x. 42. xxiii. 3, 10. which ſaith, <hi>It was the Word of the Lord that fought for them;</hi> and v. 13. which ſaith, <hi>It was the VVord which caſt out the Nations before them.</hi>

               <p>Of Divine Appearances in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> we read of one to <hi>Gideon,</hi> that ſeems to have been of an Angel of God, for ſo he is called, <hi>Judg.</hi> vi. 11, 12. And again, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21, 22. In this laſt place it is alſo ſaid that <hi>Gideon perceived he was an Angel of the Lord, (i. e.)</hi> He ſaw that this was an Heavenly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that came to him, with a Meſſage from God. And yet that he was no created Angel it ſeems by his being oftner called the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 16, 23, 24, 25, 27. And <hi>Gideon</hi> in that whole Hiſtory never addreſs'd himſelf to any other but God. The Meſſage delivered from God by this Angel to <hi>Gideon, ver.</hi> 16. is thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the <hi>Targum, Surely my Word ſhall be thy help, and thou ſhalt ſmite the Midianites as one man.</hi> The Word that help'd <hi>Gideon</hi> againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> was no other than he that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Joſhua</hi> with a Sword in his hand, <hi>Joſh.</hi> v. 13. That was now <hi>the Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon, Judg.</hi> vii. 18, 20. And what the Ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church meant by the Word of the Lord in this place, one may gueſs by their <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Judg.</hi> vi. 12, 13. Where the Angel ſaying to <hi>Gideon, The Word of the Lord is thy help;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Is the Shekinah of the Lord our help; whence then hath all this happen'd to us?</hi> It is plain by this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe that they reckoned the Word of the Lord to be the ſame with the <hi>Shekinah</hi> of the Lord, even him by whom God ſo gloriouſly appeared for their deliverance. And indeed they could hardly be miſtaken in the Perſon of that Angel, who ſaith that his Name is <hi>Pele,</hi> the Wonderful, which is uſed <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ix. amongſt the Names of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which

               <p>The Angel that appeared to <hi>Manoah,</hi> Judg. xiii. could ſeem to have been no other than a created Angel; but the Name which he takes of <hi>Pele,</hi> the Wonderful, ſhews that he was the Word of the Lord, or the Angel of the Lord, <hi>l.</hi> lxiii. 8.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> we read of no other ſuch Appearance, but that which God made to <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> iii. 21. and that was only by <hi>a Voice from the Temple of the Lord, where the Ark was</hi> at that time, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4.

But that in the Opinion of the Ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church the Word of the Lord was their King, and the Tabernacle was his Palace, where his Throne was upon the Ark between the Cherubims; and that from thence the Word gave his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; all this has been ſo fully proved before in this Chapter, that to prove it here again would be ſuperfluous; and therefore I take it for granted, that in their Opinion it was the Word of the Lord from whom this Voice came to <hi>Samuel.</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93550:132"/> as ſoon upon the Prince as the Peaſant, <hi>David</hi> made choice of it rather than either of the other; ſaying withal, <hi>Let me not fall into the hands of Man, but into the hands of the Lord; for great are his Mercies,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi. 13. Thereupon God ſent a Peſtilence upon all the Coaſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by which there fell Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty thouſand Men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 15. And to repreſent to <hi>David</hi>'s Bodily Eyes an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Inſtance, as well of God's Juſtice in puniſhing Sinners, as of his Mercy to them upon their Repentance and Prayer, God made him ſee <hi>an Angel ſtanding between the Earth and the Heaven, having a drawn Sword in his hand ſtretch'd out over Jeruſalem</hi> to deſtroy it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 16, 17. And 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi. 16. And when at this Sight <hi>David</hi> fell upon his face, and prayed, as it followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.

This was no other than a Created Angel, whom God that employ'd him in that Service, appointed to appear in that manner, for all thoſe purpoſes before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>What the Ancient Church thought of all this Paſſage of Hiſtory, we may eaſily gueſs by what has been already ſhewn, of their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93550:132"/> aſcribing all Rewards and Puniſhments to the Word, that had the Conduct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over God's People. And though it ſeems that Care has been taken to conceal this Notion of theirs, as much as was poſſible, in the <hi>Targums</hi> of the Books now before us; yet here is a Paſſage that ſeems to have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Correctors, by which we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Church's Senſe here was agreeable to what we find of it in all other places. For in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 14. where we find in the Text that <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Let us fall now into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nd of the Lord, for his Mercies are great;</hi> the <hi>Targum</hi> thus renders theſe words, <hi>Let me be delivered into the hand of the Word of the Lord, for great are his Mercies.</hi> It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi> into whoſe hands <hi>David</hi> fell: It was his Angel by whom the Judgment was executed: And it was alſo <hi>his Mercy</hi> by which the Judgment was ſuſpended and revoked. The <hi>Targum</hi> on this Text ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhews that all this was the Senſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the Ancient Church conſidered the Word as being their Sovereign Lord and King of the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> All thoſe Kings whoſe Acts are deſcribed in the Two Books of Kings, they look'd upon as his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants or Deputies, that held their Title from and under him by his Covenant with <hi>David</hi> their Father. This <hi>Solomon</hi> declared in theſe words, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> viii. 15. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who by his Word made a Covenant with David my Father.</hi> Whatſoever God did for his People under their Government, in protecting and delivering them from their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93550:133"/> Enemies; they own'd that it was <hi>for his Word's ſake, and for his Servant David's ſake,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 34. xx. 6. When they had quite broken his Covenant, then <hi>God removed them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Word,</hi> and gave them up to be a Scorn to all Nations, as he threatned he would, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. 7. according to their <hi>Targum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe Books we read of no more but Two Divine Appearances in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, and both theſe were made to <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. 2.</p>
               <p>The firſt was at <hi>Gibeon, chap.</hi> iii. 5. where the Lord appeared to <hi>Solomon in a dream by night,</hi> and ſaid to him, Ask what I ſhall give thee. He asked nothing but Wiſdom; which ſo pleaſed the Lord, that he gave him not only that, but alſo Riches and Honour above all the Kings then in the Word. The <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> as it is come to our hands, doth not ſay, It was the Word of the Lord that appeared to him, and that gave him all this. But that it was ſo according to the Senſe of their Church, may be gathered from the Text, which tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. That as ſoon as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> was <hi>awake,</hi> he went preſently to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> (which was about ſeven Miles diſtant) and there <hi>he ſtood before the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord</hi> (which was there in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſet up by <hi>David</hi> his Father;) <hi>and he offered up both Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings, and made a Feaſt to all his Servants.</hi> The haſte in which all this was done, brings us preſently to the Occaſion of it; for of all Peace-Offerings for Thankſgiving to God, the ſame day that they were offered, the Fleſh muſt be eaten, <hi>Lev.</hi> vii. 15. the Breaſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93550:133"/> and Right Shoulder by the Prieſts, all the reſt by the Offerer, and thoſe that he had to eat with him. It is plain therefore that this was a Sacrifice of Thankſgiving to God. But why ſhould not <hi>Solomon</hi> have ſtaid at <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon,</hi> and there paid this Duty where he had received the Obligation? Eſpecially ſince there at <hi>Gibeon</hi> was the Tabernacle which <hi>Moſes</hi> made by God's Command; and there was the Brazen Altar which <hi>Bezaleel</hi> made, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> i. 2, 3, 4. and <hi>Solomon</hi> had come on purpoſe to <hi>Gibeon</hi> to ſacrifice upon that Altar at that time. The very day before this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God he had offered a thouſand Burnt-Offerings upon it, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and <hi>in that very night did God appear to him, ver.</hi> 7. Now <hi>Solomon</hi> having found that good Succeſs of his ſacrificing at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> that preſently God appeared to him, and gave him ſo great a Boon, would certainly have ſtaid there to have paid his Thankſgiving in that Place, but that he underſtood that he that appeared to him was the Word, whoſe eſpecial Preſence was with the Ark at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as we have abundantly proved. To Him therefore he haſten'd immediately to pay his Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Peace-Offerings of Thankſgiving to the Word of the Lord. This we cannot doubt was the Senſe of the Ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, though it doth not appear now in their <hi>Targums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it was the Word that made that firſt Appearance to <hi>Solomon,</hi> then it muſt be He that made the ſecond alſo; for both theſe Appearances were of the ſame Perſon. So it is ſaid expreſly in the Text, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. 2.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93550:134"/> 
                  <hi>The Lord appeared to Solomon the ſecond time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.</hi> But of this ſecond Appearance, that it was of the Word of the Lord, there is a clearer Proof than of the former; as the Reader will certainly judge, if he conſiders the Circumſtances of this ſecond Appearance, and the Words which God ſpake to <hi>Solomon</hi> on this occaſion. Firſt, the time of this Divine Appearance to <hi>Solomon,</hi> was when he had finiſh'd the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Houſe of the Lord, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. 1. He had brought the Ark into the moſt Holy Place, even under the Wings of the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> viii. 6. The Glory of the Lord had taken poſſeſſion of this Houſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. and <hi>Solomon</hi> had made his Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before it, <hi>ver.</hi> 12,—61. Thereupon God appears, and tells him, <hi>I have heard thy Prayer and Supplication that thou haſt made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. I have hallowed this Houſe</hi> which thou haſt built, ix. 3. that is, I have taken it for my own <hi>to put my name there for ever,</hi> 1 Chron. vii. 12. <hi>I have choſen this place to my ſelf for a Houſe of Sacrifice.</hi> This was a plain declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, that it was of this Houſe that he had ſpoken by <hi>Moſes</hi> in theſe words, Deut. xii. 5, 11. <hi>There ſhall be a place which the Lord your God ſhall chuſe to place his Name there; thither ſhall you bring all that I command you, your Burnt-offerings and your Sacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſee how thoſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi> are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Deuteronomy: There will be a place which the Word of the Lord will chuſe to place his Shekinah there: Thither ſhall you bring your Offerings,</hi> &amp;c. Here the Reader cannot but ſee that he that appeared
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93550:134"/> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſaid to him, <hi>I have choſen this place,</hi> &amp;c. all along in the Firſt Perſon, is the ſame of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid all the ſame things, ſpeaking of him in the Third Perſon. And that as it appears in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum</hi> both <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. of that Chapter, this was no other than <hi>the Word,</hi> according to the mind of the Ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; though in their <hi>Targum</hi> on 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. (which alſo is called <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s, but how truly, the Reader may ſee by this Inſtance) there is not the leaſt mention of the Word upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The Word of the Lord being now in his Reſting-place in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> viii. 41. and having put an end to his Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, by ſetting up Kings of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Race, that came in by Hereditary Succeſſion, and governed after the manner of the Kings of other Nations; after this, in the Scripture-Hiſtory of thoſe Times, while the firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was ſtanding, we read of no more ſuch Divine Appearances as we had formerly.</p>
               <p>There is only one to be excepted, namely, that which was made to <hi>Elias</hi> in a ſmall ſtill Voice, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. Of which ſomething ought to be ſaid more particularly. It may be obſerved that this was in that part of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which had no Communion with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It was in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s time, when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had not only caſt off the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> but ſeem'd to have quite forſaken the Covenant which God had made with their Fathers by his Servant <hi>Moſes.</hi> To reduce them to their duty, God had now ſent <hi>Elias,</hi> who was a kind of ſecond <hi>Moſes.</hi> God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93550:135"/> ſhewed he was ſo, by putting him into ſo many of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Circumſtances. After a Faſt of Forty Days, ſuch as none but <hi>Moſes</hi> had ever kept before him, he comes to <hi>Horeb</hi> the Mount of God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 8. So called firſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> iii.i. in the Hiſtory of God's firſt appearing to <hi>Moſes</hi> in that place. And as there, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Moſes</hi> hid his Face, being afraid to look upon God; ſo did <hi>Elias</hi> in this place, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 13. He wrapt his Face in his Mantle; and then God ſpoke to him as he had done at firſt unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> He that ſpoke now was the ſame that ſpoke then, as appears by comparing the Circumſtances; and he that ſpoke then, was God the Word, as we have proved before in this Chapter. This muſt needs have been the Senſe of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. And to us Chriſtians it cannot but look very agreeable, That as when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were upon the Earth, the Word appeared to them, and ſpoke with them on Mount <hi>Horeb:</hi> So when he was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> came to him on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and ſpoke with him at his Transfiguration.</p>
               <p>Of thoſe Appearances of Angels to <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 5, 7. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> i. And of the Angel that made that Slaughter in <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 35. we have no more to ſay in this place; becauſe they ſeem to have been no other but Created Angels, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is called the Word of the Lord in their <hi>Targum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we are concerned for that Viſion of God which was ſeen by the Prophet <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xxii. 19. although he doth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93550:135"/> not ſay that God appeared to him, nor that he ſaw any thing more of God than a meer reſemblance of a King ſitting in State, which was at that time viſibly repreſented before him. For we muſt take notice of one thing, which is of ſome moment, that is, that when he ſaith, <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting on his Throne, and all the Hoſt of Heaven ſtanding by him on his right hand and on his left, &amp;c.</hi> the moſt Learned <hi>Jews</hi> conceive that he ſaw the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinah</hi> with the Angels of his Attendance, and that this Viſion of <hi>Micaiah</hi> is the ſame which was ſhewn to <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> vi. and to ſome other Prophets.</p>
               <p>In the Prophetical Books of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> there are two Appearances of God, or of the <hi>Shekinah</hi> in his Temple, which we are obliged to give ſome account of. And of theſe, as I ſhall ſhew, we have no reaſon to doubt but that it was the <hi>Word</hi> that appeared to thoſe Prophets according to the ſenſe of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt for that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> vi. 1, &amp;c. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a Throne, high, and lifted up, and his Train filled the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; above it ſtood the Cherubims, &amp;c. crying one to another, and ſaying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord of Hoſts, the whole Earth is full of thy glory:— and the Houſe was filled with ſmoke.</hi> That this Houſe was the Temple is expreſly ſaid in the end of the firſt verſe. And the ſmoke was the token of the <hi>Shekinah</hi> of God, with which the Temple was filled now, as it was at his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> viii. 10, 11. So that here, <hi>the Lord ſitting upon his Throne,</hi> was no other than God ſitting upon his Mercy-ſeat
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93550:136"/> over the Ark; that is, He was the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, according to the opinion of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, as has been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved before in this Chapter. Of which here is alſo ſome remain in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe; for whereas the Prophet ſpeaking ſtill of the Lord whom he ſaw ſitting on his Throne, <hi>v.</hi> 1. ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Alſo I heard the voice of the Lord, ſaying, whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> The <hi>Targum</hi> thus renders it, <hi>I heard the Voice of the Word of the Lord, ſaying, Whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> We Chriſtians need not thank them for this, being fully aſſured as we are by what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> xii. 41. that this was no other than our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For there the Apoſtle having quoted the words that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> heard from the Lord that ſpoke to him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> vi. 9, 10. tells us, <hi>Theſe things ſaid Iſaiah when he ſaw his Glory, and ſpoke of him.</hi> That the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of <hi>the Word made fleſh,</hi> is clear enough from the Text. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it has been proved by our Writers beyond all contradiction.<note place="margin">See <hi>Plac.</hi> lib. ii. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put. 1.</note>

               <p>In like manner that which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw, was an Appearance of God, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him as a Man ſitting on a Throne of Glory, <hi>Ezek.</hi> i. 26, 27, 28. x. 1. Which Throne was then upon Wheels, after the manner of a <hi>Sella Curulis.</hi> They were living Wheels, animated and ſupported by <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,</hi> i. 21. each of which had four Faces, i. 6. ſuch as were carved on the Walls of the Temple, xli. 19. In ſhort, that which <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> ſaw, though he was then in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> was nothing elſe but the Appearance of God as yet dwelling in his Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93550:136"/> quite weary of it, and now about to remove, and to leave his dwelling-place to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> To ſhew that this was the meaning of it, he ſaw this Glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God, firſt, <hi>in his place,</hi> iii. 12. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> on the Mercy-ſeat in the Temple, ix. 3. Next, he ſaw him gone from his place, <hi>to the Threſhold of the Houſe.</hi> Judges uſe to give Judgment in the Gate; ſo there over the Threſhold of his Houſe God gave Sentence againſt his rebellious people, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, from the Threſhold of the Houſe, x. 4. the Prophet ſaw the Glory departed yet farther, and <hi>mounted up from the Earth over the midſt of the City,</hi> x. 18, 19. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaw it go from thence, and <hi>ſtand upon the Mountain on the Eaſt-ſide of the City,</hi> xi. 23. That is, on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> which is before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on the Eaſt, <hi>Zech.</hi> xiv. 4. and ſo the <hi>Targum</hi> has it on this place. After this depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Divine Preſence, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw his forſaken Temple and City deſtroyed, and his People carried away into Captivity, xxxiii. 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this he ſaw no more Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, till his People's return from Captivity. And then the Temple being rebuilt according to the meaſures given from God, xl, xli, xlii, the Prophet could not but expect that God would return to it as of old. So he ſaw it come to paſs in his Viſion, xliii. 2. <hi>Behold the Glory of the God of Iſrael came from the way of the Eaſt,</hi> (where the Prophet ſaw it laſt, at M. <hi>Olivet.</hi>) So again, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>The Glory of the Lord came into the Houſe by the way of the Gate whoſe proſpect is toward the Eaſt,</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Behold the Glory of the Lord filled the Houſe.</hi> So again, xliv. 4. <hi>It filled the Houſe</hi> now, as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93550:137"/> it had done in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, 1 <hi>King.</hi> viii. 11. All along in this Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> it was but one Perſon that appeared, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end. In the beginning of this Prophecy, it was God that appeared in his Temple over the <hi>Cherubims;</hi> and there we find him again in the end of this Prophecy. But that it was no other but <hi>the Word</hi> that ſo appeared <hi>in the Temple,</hi> according to the ſenſe of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo fully out of their <hi>Targums</hi> elſwhere, that we need not trouble our ſelves about that any farther, though we cannot find it in the <hi>Targum</hi> on this Book.</p>
               <p>In the Books of <hi>Chronicles</hi> there is nothing remarkable of this kind, but what has been conſidered already, in the account that we have given of the Divine Appearances in the Books of <hi>Kings.</hi> And there is no mention of any ſuch Appearance in any of the other Books that were written after the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, except on the Books of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Zechariah.</hi> Of <hi>Daniel</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us any <hi>Targum,</hi> therefore we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay of that Book. They have given us a <hi>Targum,</hi> ſuch as it is, of the Book of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> which is the laſt we have to conſider.</p>
               <p>In this Book of <hi>Zechariah</hi> we read of three Angels that appeared to the Prophet. The firſt appeared to him as a Man, i. 8,-10. But is called an Angel, <hi>v.</hi> 9. In <hi>Zechary</hi>'s words, <hi>The Angel that talked with me:</hi> By which Title he is often diſtinguiſht from all others in the ſame Book, i. 13, 14, 19. ii. 3. v. 5, 6. vi. 4. A ſecond Angel appeared to him alſo as <hi>a Man</hi> with a Meaſuring Line in his hand, ii. 1. But whoſoever compares this Text with
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93550:137"/> 
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> xl. 3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will find that this, who appeared as <hi>a Man,</hi> was truly an Angel of God. Next, the firſt Angel going forth from the place where he appeared, ii. 3. <hi>Another Angel</hi> comes to meet him, and bids him, <hi>Run, ſpeak to this young man,</hi> (whether to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel Surveyor, or whether to <hi>Zechary</hi> himſelf) and tell him, <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall be inhabited, &amp;c.</hi> ii. 4. He that commands another ſhould be his Superior. And yet this Superior owns himſelf <hi>ſent</hi> from God. But he own'd it in ſuch terms as ſhew'd that he was God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This the Reader will ſee more than once in his ſpeech, which is continued from <hi>v.</hi> 4. to the end of the Chapter. It appears eſpecially in <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 11. of this Chapter. Firſt in <hi>v.</hi> 5. having declared what God would do for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in theſe words according to the Targum, <hi>The Lord hath ſaid, my Word ſhall be a wall of fire about her, and my Glory will I place in the midſt of her;</hi> He goes on to <hi>v.</hi> 8. and there he delivers a Meſſage from God to his People, in theſe words, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, After the Glory</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">After the <hi>Glory</hi> of his <hi>Shekinah</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, when that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, they ſhould ſoon after ſee <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelf ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and <hi>ſpotled</hi> by their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the <hi>Perſians.</hi>

But ſo it is again, and much clearer expreſt in <hi>v.</hi> 9. where he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I will ſhake my hand upon them, and they ſhall be a ſpoil to their Servants.</hi> This none but God could ſay: But he addeth in the next words, <hi>And ye ſhall know that the Lord of Hoſts hath ſent me;</hi> which words plainly ſhew that, though he ſtiled himſelf God, yet he came as a Meſſenger from God. This is plainer yet, <hi>v.</hi> 11. where
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93550:138"/> he ſaith, <hi>Many Nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord in that day, and ſhall be my people, and I will dwell in the midſt of thee,</hi>

                  </note> (Thee, Oh <hi>Zion, v.</hi> 10.) This again none but God could ſay: And yet it followeth, <hi>Thou</hi> (Oh <hi>Zion) ſhalt know that the Lord of Hoſts hath ſent me to Thee,</hi> (Oh <hi>Zion.</hi>) Here are plainly two Perſons called by the name of <hi>Jehovah;</hi> namely, one that ſends, and another that is ſent; So that this ſecond Perſon is God, and yet he is alſo the Meſſenger of God.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe in the next Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 1. the Angel that uſed to talk with the Prophet ſhewed him <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High Prieſt, ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and <hi>Satan</hi> ſtanding over againſt <hi>Joſhua</hi> as his Adverſary. And <hi>v.</hi> 2. the Prophet hears the Lord ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Satan</hi> twice over, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,</hi> for being ſo maliciouſly bent againſt <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that was come out of the Captivity <hi>as a brand pluckt out of the fire.</hi> He that was called the Angel, <hi>v.</hi> 1. is here called the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and this Lord intercedes with the Lord for his Protection of <hi>Joſhua</hi> againſt <hi>Satan.</hi> That which gave the Devil advantage againſt <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> was his Sins; which, as the <hi>Targum</hi> ſaith, were the Marriages of his Sons to ſtrange Wives. His Sins, whatſoever they were, are here called <hi>filthy Garments;</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe before the Angel, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. The Angel commands them that ſtood about him, ſaying, <hi>take away the filthy garments from him.</hi> Here again, by commanding the Angels, he ſheweth himſelf their Superior. Afterward, when the filthy Cloaths were taken off, this Angel ſaith to <hi>Joſhua, Behold I have cauſed thy

This could be no other than he that was called of God, <hi>a Prieſt for ever after, the order of Melchizedek,</hi> Pſal. cx. 4. of whom the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High Prieſt, even <hi>Joſhua</hi> himſelf, was but a figure. But he goes farther, adding, <hi>I will cloth thee with change of raiment,</hi> that is, according to the <hi>Targum, I will cloth thee with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> ver. 5. <hi>And he</hi>

It is an Angel's Office to be the Meſſenger of God; and ſo he often owned himſelf to be, in ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſent me.</hi> And yet this Meſſenger of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Angels, ii. 4. iii. 4, 5. and himſelf ſtands by to ſee them do his commands, <hi>v.</hi> 5. This Angel calleth <hi>Iſrael</hi> his People, and ſaith, he will dwell among them, ii. 10, 11. He takes upon him to protect his People, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and to avenge them on their enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 10. He intercedes with God, iii. 2. He forgives ſin, and confers Righteouſneſs, iii. 4. If all theſe things cannot be truly ſaid of one and the ſame Perſon; then here are two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters together that are each of them half Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, and there is no way to reconcile them with ſenſe, but by putting ſome kind of <hi>force</hi> upon the Text, whether by changing the

               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub"> That the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> did often uſe the Notion of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Word, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Meſſias.</head>
               <p>I Hope what I have ſaid upon the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the Word in the Old Teſtament, proves beyond exception that the Word, which is ſpoken of in the ancient Books of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is a Perſon and a Divine one. From thence it is natural to conclude that St. <hi>John</hi> and the other Holy Writers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament who made uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, could not rationally give to that word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, any other Idea, than that which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>Nothing more can be required from me than to refute fully the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> who pretend that the Word ſignifies no more than an Attribute or the eternal vertue of God, and who to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this aſſertion of theirs obſerve that in the <hi>Targums</hi> the term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is never employed when they ſpeak of the Meſſias. The <hi>Socinian</hi> Author who wrote againſt <hi>Wecknerus</hi> inſiſts very much upon this obſervation.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore examine how true that is which he affirms, and ſuppoſing it true, how rational the conſequence is which he draws from thence in oppoſition to it I lay down theſe three Propoſitions, which I ſhall conſider in as many Chapters: The firſt is, that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of the Ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93550:140"/> the <hi>Memra</hi> or the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is put for the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as. And ſo that it is certain that St. <hi>John</hi> hath followed the Language of the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt in taking the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for a Divine Perſon that in the fulneſs of time, as it was foretold by the Prophets, did aſſume our fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 14.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of old did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Meſſias ſhould be the proper Son of God.</p>
               <p>The laſt is, that the Meſſias was repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Old Teſtament as being <hi>Jehovah</hi> that ſhould come, and that the ancient Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue did believe him to be ſo.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
               <p>And upon this I muſt put my Reader in mind, that it ſhould not be a juſt ſubject of admiration, if we could not prove ſuch a thing by many of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Books. It is clear that when the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they conſidered him as the true Lord of Heaven and Earth, and chiefly of their own Nation. Whereas the Meſſias is often repreſented to the Prophets as one that ſhould appear in a very mean condition; and whatſoever glory is attributed to him in other places of the Ancient Revelation, which brought them to believe till the laſt times that the <hi>Shekinah</hi> was to be in him; there were ſome Characters which could hardly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him as being Perſonally the Word himſelf. Such are his Sufferings deſcribed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxii. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> liii. Such is his riding upon an Aſs, and coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which they refer conſtantly to the Meſſias, as you may
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93550:140"/> ſee in their Ceremonial Book or <hi>Aggada</hi> of <hi>Peſach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But altho we ſhould ſuppoſe that the places we are going to cite cannot expreſly convince the Reader of this truth: yet we might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it by neceſſary conſequences from them.</p>
               <p>For example, It is univerſally received, that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpeaks of the Meſſiah, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. <hi>Onkelos</hi> Paraphraſes it, the People ſhall obey him. And yet, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 24. he makes the <hi>Word</hi> the Governour of <hi>the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ancient <hi>Jews</hi> hold, that the <hi>Word</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to the <hi>Word</hi> they apply all the Appearances aſcribed to the Angel of the Lord. Does it not follow from hence, that they underſtood the Meſſiah by the <hi>Word?</hi> ſince they confeſs, the Meſſiah is called the <hi>Angel of his Preſence,</hi> Iſa. lxiii. 10. <hi>the Angel of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. iii. 1. which words they refer conſtantly to the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>The ancient <hi>Jews</hi> affirm, that it was upon the motion of the <hi>Word</hi> that their Anceſtors were to move, and that <hi>He</hi> ordered them to prepare themſelves for a ſight of God. <hi>Onk.</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xix. 17. And is not this it which <hi>Amos</hi> demands of the People with reſpect to the Meſſiah? <hi>ch.</hi> iv. 12.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> relate that the Temple was built for the <hi>Word,</hi> as was alſo the Tabernacle, where the Majeſty of the <hi>Word</hi> reſided. After this, whom could they underſtand, but the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, of whom <hi>Malachy</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he ſhould come to his Temple? <hi>chap.</hi> iii. 1. which words relate conſtantly to the Meſſias.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:93550:141"/>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> thought him to be the Meſſias, that is ſpoken of by <hi>Zech. ch.</hi> vi. 22. And whom elſe could they think him but the <hi>Word,</hi> who is named by <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Eaſt? and the Sun of Righteouſneſs by <hi>Mal.</hi> iv. 2.

               <p>This place of <hi>Philo</hi> deſerves a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſideration.

               <p>Nor is it of leſs uſe to confound the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> For it is a proof not to be denied of St. <hi>John</hi>'s following the Language of the old Synagogue, when he ſpeaks of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>But ſaith <hi>Philo,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is called a Man, which muſt be underſtood either upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his frequent Appearances as a Man, and ſo he is called, <hi>Exod.</hi> xv. 3. or to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended manifeſtation in human ſhape, as a Servant. This latter is the Notion of <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxii. above quoted, and of <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlii. 1. <hi>Behold my Servant,</hi> which <hi>Jonathan</hi> refers to the Meſſias. And again of <hi>Iſa.</hi> liii. where the Meſſias is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a Man afflicted and tormented; which has been their ſenſe ſo conſtantly, that from hence the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince Jeſus Chriſt have taken occaſion to aſſert that the Meſſias was Leprous.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, it is viſible from <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlix. where the Meſſias is ſpoken of throughout, that the <hi>Memra</hi> ſhould become the Meſſias: Theſe are the words of <hi>Iſaiah, v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Liſten, O Iſles unto me, and hearken you people from far. The Lord hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name, and he hath made my mouth like a ſharp ſword, in the ſhadow
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93550:143"/> of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſhaft, in his quiver hath he hid me, and ſaid unto me, Thou art my Servant, O Iſrael, in whom I will be glorified: Then I ſaid, I have laboured in vain—yet ſurely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God. And now ſaith the Lord that formed me from the womb, to be his ſervant, to bring Jacob again to him; tho Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength. And he ſaid, is it a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my Servant to raiſe up the Tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael? I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maiſt be my Salvation unto the end of the Earth.</hi> Now as <hi>Philo</hi> hath obſerved that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not only called a Man, but <hi>Iſrael. De Confuſ.

And ſo every <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writer confeſſes that the Reſtauration of the Ten Tribes which is foretold there ſhall be the work of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</p>
               <p>We read <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxiii. 14. <hi>As a beaſt goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord cauſeth him to reſt, ſo didſt thou lead thy people to make thy ſelf a Glorious name.</hi> Where, notwithſtanding the Text hath <hi>the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> reads the <hi>Word,</hi> whom it treats as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, <hi>v.</hi> 14. that guided them through the Wilderneſs, that is in the Heavens, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and hath the name of Redeemer from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>

               <p>Indeed, that the <hi>Word</hi> ſhould become the Meſſias, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhould reveal himſelf in him, according to the judgment of the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, may be gathered from the method of the <hi>Jews</hi> in explaining certain places of the Meſſias which they referred to the <hi>Word of the Lord.</hi> Till now they do agree, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of the Meſſias, <hi>Exod.</hi> iv. 13. <hi>Send I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend: R.

But the <hi>Jews</hi> formerly referred it to the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, as we ſee in <hi>Onkelos</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 12. <hi>And God ſaid, certainly I will be with thee, and this ſhall be a token unto thee that I have ſent thee, when thou haſt brought forth the people out of Egypt, you ſhall ſerve God upon this mountain.</hi> On which words <hi>Onkelos</hi> obſerves, that God promiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to aſſiſt him by his <hi>Word</hi> in the truſt committed to him, and repeats it on <hi>Exod.</hi> iv. 12, 15. from which it is to be concluded, that it is whom he intends, <hi>v.</hi> 13. The like remarks are made by <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum</hi> on the ſame Texts, from whence the like inference may be drawn.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only mention a few more places: as, 1. It was the <hi>Word</hi> that promiſed to march among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and to be their God, <hi>Philo de Nom. mutat. p.</hi> 840. this, ſaith <hi>Philo</hi> in an 100 places, it was the <hi>Word</hi> that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Preſence, ſaith <hi>Onkelos</hi> on <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvi. 9, 11, 12.

               <p>It might be gathered from ſeveral things in the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be more than a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to deſtroy the Works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and whoſoever did that, muſt be ſtronger than he, as our Saviour ſhews in the Parable of the ſtrong man, <hi>Matth.</hi> xii. 29. Becauſe God reſpecting the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> promiſed to dwell in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Sem,</hi> Gen. ix. 27. which the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood of the <hi>Shekina, Talm. Babyl. Joma, fol.</hi> 9. <hi>col.</hi> 2. Becauſe he was to bleſs all Nations, as was promiſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. xii. 3. as it is acknowledged by the Author of the Book <hi>Chaſidim,</hi> §. 961. and that could not be done but by the <hi>Shekinah dwelling</hi> among them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge it. Becauſe he was to be King of all Nations of the Earth, as <hi>Jacob</hi> prophecied, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. and as <hi>Balaam</hi> foretold of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Onkelos,</hi> he was to ſmite the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Moab,</hi> and deſtroy all the Children of <hi>Seth;</hi> or as <hi>Onkelos</hi> renders it, to have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all the Children of men, <hi>Num.</hi> xxiv. 17.</p>
               <p>But it was neceſſary that the notion of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be yet more diſtinct. And to this end, there was a conſtant Succeſſion of Prophets from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Malachi,</hi> who by their particular Characters of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a more ardent deſire in the <hi>Jews,</hi> that God would fulfil his promiſe concerning him.</p>
               <p>Let us enquire a little, by what degrees this Light became more diſtinct, and ſhew what impreſſion it cauſed in the <hi>Jews</hi> before the coming of our Lord.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:93550:146"/>
               <p>I lay it down then as a truth, that the Prophets from <hi>David</hi> do conſtantly repreſent the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as the proper Son of God, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by a proper, and not a figurative Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>That God hath a Son is declared in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxx. 4. <hi>What is his name, and what is his Son's name?</hi> For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clearly by the deſcription of God's Works and Attributes, which goes before theſe words, that this Queſtion cannot be underſtood but of the true God, and of his true Son, the ſame which is ſpoken of <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 22. as being Eternal, and Verſes 24, and 25. as being begotten by God. And indeed although the Author of the <hi>Zohar</hi> refers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe words, <hi>What is his Son's name?</hi> to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who is called the firſt-born of God; nevertheleſs he gives them their true ſenſe in referring them to the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> who is ſpoken of in <hi>Pſalm</hi> ii. in theſe words, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> and <hi>kiſs the Son,</hi> Part 3. fol. 124. col. 3.</p>

               <p>Nothing can be more expreſs for to prove that there is a Son in the Godhead, than what we read in the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Gen. iii. 22.

               <p>I own alſo, that we find not in the body of <hi>Philo</hi>'s Works any formal Explication of theſe words, <hi>This day have I begotten thee;</hi> from whence we can directly conclude, that he underſtood them of an Eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>The ſame Title of Son is given to the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> Pſal. lxxii. 17.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93550:149"/> muſt have been the proper Son of God. I will ſhew ſome Inſtances of what I advance, to ſpare the trouble to my Reader.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, They maintain that this Wiſdom by which God hath founded the Earth, as <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> ciii. 24. is the ſame which is ſpoken by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. iii. 19.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, They take indifferently this Wiſdom and the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> or the <hi>Memra</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for the ſame Perſon, referring to it the ſame Actions, the ſame Power, the ſame Worſhip, the ſame Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, They underſtand the Wiſdom which rules the World, as it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. to be the ſame which is ſpoken of, <hi>Prov.</hi> iii. 19. and to be the Son of the living God, the ſame who ſpoke by <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxii. 2. ſee <hi>R.

               <p>And <hi>fourthly,</hi> They refer many Places to that Wiſdom which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Sheki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> and the Son, to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is clear that <hi>Pſalm</hi> xlv. belongs to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as being the Bridegroom of the Church.

               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:93550:149"/>
               <p>So they refer the <hi>Song of Solomon</hi> to the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinah</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Menach. fol.</hi> 44. <hi>col.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>It is notorious that the <hi>Goel,</hi> that famous Redeemer which is promiſed in ſo many Prophets to the Synagogue, is the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Now the conſtant Idea of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers is, that the <hi>Shekinah</hi> is to be that very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. <hi>Rab.

               <p>So that nothing is more evident, than that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who took the Wiſdom to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the proper Son of God, and look upon the <hi>Shekinah</hi> or the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> muſt have lookt upon the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as being the proper Son of God.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> iv. 2. the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is called the <hi>branch of the Lord,</hi> no doubt as properly as he is called <hi>the branch of David,</hi> Jerem. xxiii. 5. <hi>In that day,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the branch of the Lord ſhall be beautiful and glorious,</hi> which is in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>'s Paraphraſe interpreted of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi> From which it is natural to conclude, that the proper Son of God was to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be the proper Son of God.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ix. 6, 7. we read of <hi>a Son given,</hi> and what are the Characters of this Son? they follow. <hi>His name ſhall be Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting

               </p>
               <p>But I have taken notice before in ſpeaking of the ſeveral appearances of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that the Angel who appeared to <hi>Gideon,</hi> and who was the <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi> keeps to the ſame notion <hi>of a branch</hi> to denote a Son, <hi>Jerem.</hi> xxiii. 5. xxxiii. 15. and the <hi>Targum</hi> explains it of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi>

                  <hi>Zachary, ch.</hi> vi. 12. doth alſo call him the <hi>branch,</hi> which not only the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt, as we have ſhewn from <hi>Philo,</hi> but thoſe after Chriſt (<hi>Echa Rabbathi, p.</hi> 58. <hi>col.</hi> 2.) interpreted of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as being the Word.</p>
               <p>And here let me remark to you a few of <hi>Philo</hi>'s Notions, which may ſerve for a Key to the right underſtanding of the Sentiments of <hi>Philo</hi> concerning divers Prophecies in the Old Teſtament. One while he ſaith, <hi>Lib. de conf. Ling.</hi> 267. that God is one, but without excluding his <hi>Word</hi> who is his Image and firſt-born, from being one with him. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, he calls the <hi>Word</hi> an Archangel, a Man, he that ſees <hi>Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> Whence comes this, but that he ſaw the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was ſometimes repreſented as Head of the Angels in reſpect of his Divinity, and at other times as a Man with regard to his intended coming in the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93550:150"/> Fleſh? To this coming he ſeems to apply the Promiſe, <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvi. 11, 12. <hi>I will walk among you, and be your God, De nom. mut. p.</hi> 840. <hi>C.</hi> I am ſure the later <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Ramban</hi> upon that place after the Author of <hi>Torath Cohanim,</hi> do build here the opinion of a real habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divinity amongſt them in the times of the Meſſias, and that they derive from one of their moſt ancient Traditions, that the Salvation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be made by God himſelf which they prove by <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. 9. where it is ſpoken of the Meſſias by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> till this day.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Philo</hi> calls the Word of the Lord the Shepherd, and quotes for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxiii. 1. <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd, De nom. mut. p.</hi> 822. <hi>&amp;</hi> 823. <hi>A. De Agric. in Euſeb. p.</hi> 323. Now the Word being the ſame with the Meſſias, <hi>c.</hi> 13. it is plain this Pſalm was in his days applied to the Meſſias, who conſequently is the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the people his ſheep. I have before obſerved the rules by which the <hi>Jews</hi> were led to the knowledg of this Truth, and therefore it is unneceſſary to touch again on them.</p>
               <p>It ſuffices to remark here, firſt that the Synagogue in <hi>Philo</hi>'s time held it a Maxim, that the name <hi>Jehovah</hi> expreſs'd the Eſſence of God. <hi>Philo Lib. Deter. pot. inſ. p.</hi> 143. <hi>C.</hi> Secondly, that the name <hi>Jehovah</hi> was the proper name of God, the name of the firſt Cauſe, and conſequently communicable to no Creature. <hi>Philo de Abrahamo, p.</hi> 280. a Truth of great moment, which is confeſſed alſo by <hi>Manaſſ. ben Iſrael, q. in Exod.</hi> 3. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> whom he takes to be meant
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93550:151"/> by the Branch in <hi>Zech.</hi> vi. 12. was to become the Meſſias, and therefore that the Meſſias is juſtly called in this reſpect the Son of God.</p>
               <p>And now it is eaſie to judge of the ſenſe the ancient Synagogue had of the Perſon of the Meſſias. It acknowledges this Son and this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as a Perſon ſubſiſting from all Eternity: Of this, if we had no other, the Text of <hi>Mic.</hi> v. 2. is a good proof, which the <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's time expounded of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, <hi>Mat.</hi> ii. 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> vii. 42. But the Notions of <hi>Philo</hi> every where do confirm it. <hi>Euſebius</hi> remarks it, <hi>De Praep.</hi> xi. 15. <hi>p.</hi> 533. and his Book <hi>de Somn. de confuſ. Ling. &amp; de prof. p.</hi> 466. are full to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Let it be obſerved that the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> calls the Meſſias the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi. 63. and when Jeſus applied to himſelf a Prophecy of the Meſſias in <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13. <hi>Hereafter ſhall you ſee the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> Mat. xxvi. 64. We are told by St. <hi>Luke</hi> what they replied, <hi>Then ſaid they all, art thou then the Son of God?</hi> Luk. xxii. 70. which is an argument that though the Title of Son of Man did very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the humble eſtate of the Meſſias, yet they were not ignorant that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould be the Meſſias, and that the Meſſias ſhould be the proper Son of God; ſuch a Son, as for whom the Clouds, the Chariot of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, ſhould be prepared to attend his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, in the time when he ſhould reveal himſelf from Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Notion is ſo deeply riveted into the minds of the <hi>Jews</hi> even ſince Chriſt's
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93550:151"/> time, that becauſe the word <hi>Anan,</hi> the Clouds is ſpoken of in this paſſage of <hi>Daniel,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have aſſerted, in conſequence of this opinion, that the Meſſias ſhall be called by this name. This we ſee in <hi>Targum</hi> on 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> iii. 34. where ſpeaking of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Elioenai,</hi> it adds, the ſeventh which is <hi>Anani</hi> is the King Meſſias. And thus it is explained in <hi>Sanhedrim, fol.</hi> 62. in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Saadia</hi> and <hi>Jarchi</hi> on <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13. and in <hi>Jalkut</hi> on <hi>Zech.</hi> iv. 7.</p>
               <p>But having ſhew'd that the <hi>Word</hi> is God, and that this <hi>Word</hi> ſhould be the Meſſias, we will now ſhew, that the <hi>Jews</hi> in conformity to their Scriptures did believe that the Meſſias, as being <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſhould appear for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Men.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the Meſſias was repreſented in the Old Teſtament as being Jehovah that ſhould come, and that the ancient Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue did believe him to be ſo.</head>
               <p>I Have ſhewed, that from <hi>David</hi>'s time the Notion of the Meſſias was conſiderably cleared by ſeveral Prophets, whom God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, to exerciſe and increaſe the deſires of his people. It is no leſs certain, that the ſame Prophets do deſcribe the Meſſias as the true <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> ſo underſtood them.</p>
               <p>This we may diſcern in the earneſt long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Faithful, ſo frequent in all the Writings of the Prophets, and in thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which the <hi>Jews</hi> conſtantly interpret of the Meſſias; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome of them ſeem not to be ſpoken of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but of the Meſſias, others to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Jehovah</hi> only, without mention of the Meſſias; but all have a particular regard to that Salvation which the <hi>Jews</hi> expected from the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſing his Sons burſts out in Prayer to God, <hi>I look for thy Salvation, O Lord, Gen.</hi> xlix. 18. which the <hi>Jews</hi> by their <hi>Targums</hi> are taught to underſtand of the Meſſias. Of him likewiſe they underſtand thoſe words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> praying that God would <hi>ſend him whom he would ſend, Exod.</hi> iv. 13. which words <hi>Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> himſelf refers to the Redeemer to come,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93550:152"/> in <hi>h. l.</hi> and ſo <hi>Ramban</hi> and others. So they underſtand <hi>David</hi>'s uſing this expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxx. 2, 3. <hi>Stir up thy ſtrength and come and ſave us, bring back, O God, and cauſe thy face to ſhine and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The <hi>Targum,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Salomon Jarchi</hi> underſtand it of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias bringing back his people from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Captivity.</p>
               <p>The Ground which they built upon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe words to the Meſſias, is clearly ſeen to thoſe who ſhall reflect upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Notion of the Synagogue, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Shekinah</hi> is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> a ſecond <hi>Jehovah</hi> to whom God ſpake in ſaying, <hi>Let us make Man. R. Menach. fol.</hi> 8. <hi>col.</hi> 3. the <hi>Jehovah</hi> merciful, the Wiſdom which hath founded the Earth. <hi>R. Men. fol.</hi> 145. <hi>col.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That it is the only Ruler of <hi>Iſrael, R. Men. fol.</hi> 153. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. That it is the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> to which all the Prayers of the <hi>Jews</hi> were directed, <hi>R. Men. fol.</hi> 159. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. That as they look upon the <hi>Shekinah</hi> as the Angel, the Redeemer, ſo all their Ideas of the Redemption, and of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have a neceſſary relation to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer who is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> ſo that all that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in all the Prophets, of the Redemption by the Meſſias, muſt by a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be referred by them to <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſias, or to the Meſſias, as being <hi>Jehovah</hi> indeed: <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> lxiv. 1. begs, <hi>Oh that thou wouldſt rent the Heavens, that thou wouldſt come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy preſence.</hi> Who doth not ſee
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93550:153"/> that he ſpeaks of the coming of God in the time of the Meſſias, by an alluſion to the time of the coming of God to give the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and now the <hi>Jews</hi> confeſs 'twas the <hi>Shekinah</hi> who gave the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai. R.

               <p>
                  <hi>Micah</hi> ſpeaks with great aſſurance, <hi>Ch.</hi> vii. 7. <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the Lord of my Salvation.</hi> Again, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>He will again have compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and will caſt all our ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi> So <hi>Hab.</hi> ii. 3. <hi>Though he tarry, wait for him, becauſe he will ſurely come, he will not tarry.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> iii. 13. <hi>Thou wenteſt forth for the Salvation of thy people, even for Salvation with thine Anointed: Thou woundeſt the head out of the houſe of the wicked, by diſcovering the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation unto the neck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Ezek.</hi> iii. 15, 17. <hi>The Lord hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy judgment, he hath caſt out thine enemy: the King of Iſrael even the Lord is in the midſt of thee; thou ſhalt not ſee evil any more—The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty: he will ſave, he will rejoyce over thee with joy: he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Zech.</hi> viii. 13. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that as you were a curſe among the heathen, O houſe of Judah, and houſe of Iſrael; ſo will I ſave you, and you ſhall be a bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Mal.</hi> iv. 2. <hi>But to you that fear my name, ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93550:153"/> his wings.</hi> Which the <hi>Jews</hi> refer to the <hi>Sheki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah. R. Menach. fol.</hi> 54. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the places that have exerciſed the thoughts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all theſe are by their <hi>Targum</hi> referred to the Word, or to the times of the Meſſias, and moſt of them (of ſuch a force is Truth) are ſtill applied ſo, by the greateſt part of their Writers, as may be ſeen in the famous Book of <hi>Ginnath Eggoz,</hi> from which <hi>Reuchlin</hi> hath almoſt extracted his Books <hi>de Cabala.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But eſpecially we ought to remark, 1. That the <hi>Targum</hi> plainly owns on <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. 6. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>O God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows;</hi> That the Meſſias is God. This Truth is yet more clear in <hi>Iſa.</hi> ix. 6. applied to the Meſſias by <hi>Jonathan;</hi> and the preſent <hi>Jews</hi> cannot ſatisfie themſelves with any anſwer they make to it, as appears by their different ways of evaſion, and their changing the very Text to avoid the evidence of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxviii. 5. hath theſe conſiderable words, <hi>In that day the Meſſias of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be crowned with joy,</hi> inſtead of <hi>the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> as it is in the Text.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. The <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Jer.</hi> xxiii. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Meſſias to be there treated of, and yet he is called in this place, <hi>the Lord of our Righteouſneſs.</hi> See to the ſame purpoſe the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> on <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxiii. 14. The learned <hi>M. Edzardi</hi> has proved that the ſame Interpretation of theſe words of <hi>Jeremy</hi> hath continued among the <hi>Jews</hi> from the time of Jeſus Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption till theſe latter days; and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93550:154"/> this he hath done from a great number of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors, and even their Liturgies themſelves which I have no mind to tranſcribe. His Book was Printed at <hi>Hamburgh, A.</hi> 1670.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. They have been ſo ſenſible that the Meſſias is repreſented by the Prophets as God, that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. where it is ſaid of the Meſſias, that he ſhall be a Prieſt according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> they refer the Prieſthood of the Meſſias to God, or to the <hi>Shekinah</hi> which is <hi>Jehovah.</hi> So doth <hi>R. Menach. fol.</hi> 18. <hi>col.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 31. <hi>col.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Without that, it is hard to conceive how <hi>Philo</hi> ſhould ſo often mention the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as a Prieſt and Prophet of God, and at the ſame time believe the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be God, unleſs he gathered it from <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. 1. where the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, that is repreſented as ſitting at the right hand of God, and equal to God, is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as an High Prieſt of a new Order; and from <hi>Iſa.</hi> xi. 2. where the Meſſias is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to receive the Spirit of Prophecy in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>I need not cite the Paraphraſts any further on this Subject. What I have already quoted out of them is more than enough to ſhew how common this Idea was among their Nation.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Ages next to theſe Paraphraſes I ought to obſerve this one thing of <hi>Pirke Eliezer, ch.</hi> xiv. There they aſſert that God deſcended nine times, and that the tenth time he ſhall deſcend in the Age to come, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the time of the Meſſias. The firſt time was in the Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> The ſecond at the Confuſion of Tongues. The third at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93550:154"/> of <hi>Sodom.</hi> The fourth at his talking with <hi>Moſes</hi> on Mount <hi>Horeb.</hi> The fifth at his appearance on <hi>Sinai.</hi> The ſixth and ſeventh where he ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the hollow of the Rock. The eighth and ninth in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. The tenth will be, when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the times of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Such is their ancient Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Prophecies that ſpeak of it, as one end of the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> to judge his People and the Nations, do conſtantly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the Name of God, or of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> We ſee it in <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxxii. 8. <hi>Ariſe, O God, and judge the earth, for thou ſhalt inherit all nations.</hi> Which is followed by <hi>Daniel, ch.</hi> vii. 13, 14. in theſe words; <hi>I ſaw in the night viſions, and behold one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the ancient of days, and there was given him dominions, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and languages ſhould ſerve him: His dominion is an everlaſting dominion that ſhall not paſs away, and his kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> confeſs three things; one is, that <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxii. is to be underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> The ſecond is, That in the Viſion of <hi>Ezech. ch.</hi> i. that form of a man ſitting upon the Throne, ſignifies the true God; the third, That the Viſion of <hi>Daniel, ch.</hi> vii. is the ſame in ſubſtance with that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> i. So that the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as a Man, receives an abſolute Empire upon all Nations, and ſits upon a Throne as God. Now it ſhould be the moſt abſurd thing in the World, to conceive the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as only a Man, when he is inveſted with ſuch an Empire which cannot be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93550:155"/> but by a true God, and by <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whoſe Character is repreſented ſo often as the Ruler of all Nations; <hi>See</hi> Gen. xviii. 25.</p>
               <p>The Prophecies that ſpeak of <hi>Jehovah</hi> as the King and Bridegroom of his Church, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly interpreted of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, where God ſaid to his People, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> ii. 19, 20. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving-kindneſs, and in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi> This the <hi>Jews</hi> generally underſtand of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> 'Tis the judgment of <hi>R. Menachem</hi> in <hi>Geneſ. fol.</hi> 15. <hi>col.</hi> 1. where he reflects upon <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> lxii. 3. And it is agreeable to what is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. 7, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever, and ever, the ſcepter of thy kingdom is a ſcepter of righteouſneſs; thou loveſt righteouſneſs and hateſt iniquity, wherefore, O God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows. Kings daughters were among thy honourable women; upon thy right hand did ſtand the Queen in gold of Ophir. Hearken, O daughter, and conſider, forget thy own people, and thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe. So ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Targum, v.</hi> 2. interprets it all of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> ſo <hi>R. Meir Arama</hi> ſays, all agree that that <hi>Pſalm</hi> is to be underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot have a better proof that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be <hi>Jehovah,</hi> than <hi>Zech.</hi> xii. 10. which the <hi>Targum</hi> alſo interprets of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> and the new <hi>Jews</hi> would refer to the feigned <hi>Meſſias,</hi> Son of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> The words
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93550:155"/> are theſe; <hi>I (Jehovah) will pour upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Malach.</hi> iii. 1. we find this expreſſion, <hi>Behold, I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple, even the meſſenger, or the Angel, of the Covenant, whom you delight in.</hi> Now take notice, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid after in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> here he is coming, the <hi>Greeks</hi> have read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now ſince it is certain that he is the <hi>Jehovah</hi> to whom the Temple is here ſaid to be built and dedicated, and who is worſhip'd in it; and ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtand this place of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> it muſt follow that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident, that the Lord, and the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger or the Angel of the Covenant, are the ſame Perſon, whoſe coming is promiſed to the <hi>Jews</hi> as a thing very near. But it is no leſs evident, that this Angel of the Covenant is the ſame which is ſpoken by <hi>Jacob,</hi> Geneſ. xlviii. 15, 16. as the Redeemer, and is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> lxiii. <hi>the Angel of the face.</hi> Now all the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> agree, that that Angel, or Meſſenger, is the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> himſelf; as we ſee in <hi>R. Menachem de Rekanati, fol.</hi> 54. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 66. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 72. <hi>col.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 73. <hi>col.</hi> And they agree all that the <hi>Shekinah</hi> and <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the ſame. It is a Point agreed by the <hi>Talmudiſt,</hi> and by the <hi>Cabaliſt,</hi> as it is explained by <hi>R. Menach.

This being ſo, who can deny that the Text of <hi>Malachi</hi> is an undeniable proof that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf, according to the Ideas of the moſt Ancient <hi>Jews?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we had not ſuch Confeſſions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> 'twill be eaſy to ſupply the want of them, by the help of the general Tradition that reigns among them, and proves clearly that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>They hold that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall be greater than all the Patriarchs, and even the Angels themſelves. <hi>Neve ſhalom, l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 5. How can this be, unleſs he be truly <hi>Jehovah?</hi> And whence could they take this Notion, except from <hi>Pſalm</hi> xcvii. 7. where the Angels are commanded to worſhip him?</p>
               <p>It is very eaſy to reconcile that Idea with the Notions of the old <hi>Jews,</hi> touching the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> ſuppoſing him to be the <hi>Shekinah</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> and that this <hi>Shekinah</hi> or <hi>Jehovah</hi> was to be the ſame Perſon with the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as they confeſs. <hi>R. Menach. fol.</hi> 73. <hi>col.</hi> 3. and <hi>fol.</hi> 77. <hi>col.</hi> 4. and <hi>fol.</hi> 79. <hi>col.</hi> 3. They teach conſtantly that Angels receive their virtue from the <hi>Shekinah, R.

                  <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 74. <hi>col.</hi> 2. They maintain on the other ſide, that 'tis not lawful to pay any religious worſhip to Angels, although ſent by God as Meſſengers of him, or as Mediators. <hi>R. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach. fol.</hi> 68. <hi>col.</hi> 2. They deny that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patriarchs have paid other worſhip than a civil one to an Angel, when he appeared to them, <hi>R. Menach. Ibidem col.</hi> 3. But it is impoſſible to reconcile thoſe Ideas with the Opinion of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> being only a meer Man.</p>
               <p>Indeed, he that will reflect on all theſe Prophecies, will very hardly think, that then, when the High-Prieſt demanded of Jeſus whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was the Son of God, and Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he was ſo; the <hi>Jews</hi> did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand only that he made himſelf a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Both the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> own that in this Anſwer he made himſelf the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which, according to both of them, is more than a great Prophet, and the High-Prieſt was ſo ſenſible of it, that he called it Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the Angels who are God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, could not ſerve nor obey one that was only, as well as themſelves, a Creature. He muſt be God, to have the Angels Subjects to him. He muſt be God, to govern the World, and to diſcern the thoughts of the heart, without which he could not be a competent Judge. And they that imagine a Creature could be made capable to know hearts, and to exerciſe thoſe other Acts, which are the Characters of the Divinity, do form to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the greateſt <hi>Chimera</hi> in the World.</p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:93550:157"/>
               <p>It is therefore neceſſary, that the Ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> having theſe Notions of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſhould have conceived an intimate and cloſe habitation of the <hi>Word</hi> in his Perſon, by which, all theſe Prophecies ſhould receive their accompliſhment, and all the Promiſes of God, concerning the Meſſias ſhould be perfectly fulfilled.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Unitarians</hi> conceive they have done a great ſervice to the Chriſtian Religion, when to court the <hi>Jews</hi> favour they deny the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Meſſias, and condemn as Idolatry the <hi>Worſhip</hi> which Chriſtians pay to Jeſus Chriſt. In this they argue more conſiſtently than <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> himſelf, as I have ſaid in my Preface to this Book. But after all I can ſay that beſides they cannot anſwer <hi>Socinus</hi> his Argument for the Worſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, they ſhall not get from the <hi>Jews</hi> what they pretend by their opinion: Indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> would be in the right to condemn us as Idolaters, if we did worſhip Jeſus Chriſt as a meer Creature. But they cannot do that juſtly, if they reflect ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon the Grounds which we lay for the Adoration of the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>As it is a thing which I hope ſhall be of ſome uſe to undeceive the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> I am willing to add to the foregoing obſervations upon the Trinity and Divinity of the World the ſenſe of the Synagogue to this Article. And indeed it would be unconceivable that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have believed the Meſſias to be true God, and ſhould not be ready to worſhip him.</p>
               <p>It is a thing which Chriſtians and <hi>Jews</hi> are agreed upon that there is but one God,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93550:157"/> who is to be Worſhipped. The <hi>Jews</hi> and the ancient Chriſtians did agree that Angels muſt not be Worſhipped. From which it follows that if the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias is to be Worſhipped, they muſt have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him to be God, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are poſitive Orders of God to Worſhip the Meſſias, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> ii. 12. <hi>Kiſs the Son.</hi> Who is that Son ſpoken in this place, it is the Meſſias, as it is granted by the ancient Synagogue, as we ſee in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, I called upon the Lord the Father of my Lord.</hi> And <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hillim Rabba,</hi> with many others, uſe this place of <hi>Pſal.</hi> ii. to the Meſſias. So the <hi>Breſhit Rabba</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. ſo the <hi>Talmud in Succa, c.</hi> 5. <hi>Saadias</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13. with the ancient, witneſs <hi>R.

But that Verſion is rejected by the <hi>Jews</hi> who read now in their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tranſlation Printed at <hi>Ferrara, Beſad hiio pro que non ſe inſanne,</hi> which is the ſenſe of <hi>Lombroſo</hi> in his ſhort Notes upon that place.

               <p>We read in <hi>Pſal.</hi> viii. 3. <hi>From the mouth of babes, &amp;c.</hi> It was ſo well known that this place was related to the Meſſias, that it was uſed at our Saviour's Entry into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Mat. xxi. 16. Since that time it is related to the Meſſias as we ſee in the <hi>Midraſh</hi> upon <hi>Cant.</hi> i. 4. where theſe very words are referred to God, whom the Babes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to bleſs, which ſhews plainly that the praiſes which are ſpoken of are praiſes which are acts of Adoration, and ſo in the <hi>Midraſh</hi> upon <hi>Eccl. ch.</hi> ix. 1.</p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:93550:158"/>
               <p>The ſame poſitive order for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Meſſias is given in <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. 11. <hi>He is the Lord, worſhip thou him.</hi> There is no doubt but that <hi>Pſalm</hi> is to be referred to the Meſſias; It is ſo acknowledged by the <hi>Targum,</hi> and by all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Interpreters. What then can be ſaid againſt the Worſhip of the Meſſias? If the <hi>Jews</hi> of old had denied that the <hi>Shekinah</hi> was to be in the Meſſias, then it ſhould be ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to conclude that they did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Worſhip which is to be paid to him. But they have acknowledged the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Meſſias, as we read in <hi>Midraſh Tehillim</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> x. <hi>Stetit Divinitas Meſſiae &amp; praedicavit.</hi> From whence it follows by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence that they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to worſhip him.</p>
               <p>We have the ſame Worſhip of the Meſſias ſetled in <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxviii. 32. where it is ſaid that the Princes ſhall extend their hands to him from <hi>Egypt.</hi> All the <hi>Jews</hi> agree that ſuch a thing is to happen at the coming of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias which we call the ſecond. So <hi>Raſhi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read the ſame in <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxii. where it is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 11. that they ſhall <hi>fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him.</hi> No body doubts but that Pſalm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>I have taken notice in the ſecond Chapter of this Book that the <hi>Jews</hi> refer conſtantly to the time of the Meſſias all the Pſalms from the xc. to the c. Now in <hi>Pſal.</hi> xcv. <hi>v.</hi> 6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. the words ſeem to be ſpoken of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> but they were underſtood by the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Meſſias who was to have the name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as you ſee in <hi>Midraſh</hi> in <hi>Echa.</hi> i. 6.</p>
               <p>After <hi>David</hi> what ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93550:158"/> of the Meſſias? he ſpeaks as diſtinctly as can be, <hi>ch.</hi> xlix. <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> underſtand it of the Meſſias, whom they look upon as the Redeemer to whom all people are to make their confeſſion from their heart, as you ſee in <hi>Breſhit Rabba</hi> upon <hi>Gen.</hi> xli. <hi>v.</hi> 44. where they refer theſe words to the Meſſias, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlv. 23. You ſee the ſame in <hi>Midr.

               <p>Some perhaps ſhall think they can avoid the ſtrength of this Argument, drawn from the Worſhip to be paid to the Meſſias, by allowing that it is ſpoken in thoſe places which I have quoted of a civil worſhip to be paid to the Meſſias as a great King.</p>
               <p>But it ſhould be in vain for a <hi>Socinian</hi> to employ ſuch an evaſion, becauſe we find that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> have prevented it by giving us inſtances of all the ſeveral Parts of ſuch a Worſhip, either Faith, Vows, or Prayers, or Sacrifices, which cannot be paid but to a true God, and I have quoted ſo many places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that point, that I do not think fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large more upon it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall then conclude this matter by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayer of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Feaſt of <hi>Succoth,</hi> where they have theſe words <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Having now produced the Sentiments of the old <hi>Jews,</hi> as to ſeveral points that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Trinity and the Divinity of our Lord, we ought next to conſider how Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Primitive Chriſtians, did follow theſe Notions of the Synagogue.</p>

               <p>It was abſolutely neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, becauſe the Doctrine concerning the coming of the Meſſias, began to be more narrowly inquired into among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they ſaw <hi>Herod</hi> who was an <hi>Idumean,</hi> ſetled in the Throne of <hi>Judaea;</hi> it being at the juſt time markt out for the coming of the Meſſias by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>Ge.</hi> xlix. 10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law-giver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his feet, until</hi> Shilo <hi>come, and unto him ſhall the gathering of people be.</hi> An Angel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appears to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> that was to be the Mother of Chriſt, and ſhews the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Conception, which was to be by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93550:160"/> places of Scripture, where the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is deſcribed as one that was to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Next the Angel appeared to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was upon parting with his betrothed Wife, the Bleſſed Virgin, and told him, ſhe ſhould bring forth a Son, and muſt name him <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he ſhould <hi>ſave</hi> his People from their ſins.

He was to do that for his People, which none but God was able to do, to ſave them from their ſins. How could he ſhew it better that he was the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom <hi>Judea</hi> belonged as his Country, and the <hi>Jews</hi> as his People, as it was foretold, <hi>Iſ.</hi> vii. and viii?

               <p>Hitherto a judicious Reader will find no notion, but what is perfectly like to thoſe of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and of the Writings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> about thoſe places of Scripture which

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> being angry with him, becauſe he had cured an impotent man on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 16. he tells them, to juſtify what he had done, <hi>My Father works hitherto, and I work, v.</hi> 17. At which words they <hi>ſought more to kill him, becauſe he had not only broken the ſabbath, but ſaid alſo that God was his Father, making himſelf equal with God, v.</hi> 18. What would a good man have done in this caſe, one that had been only Man as we are? He would certainly have declared his abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſuch Blaſphemy as was contain'd in theſe words. But then he would have told them theſe were not his words, but theirs. He would have them underſtand him aright, by ſaying, he did not make himſelf equal with God, but that in working a Miracle on the Sabbath, he only acted as the Prophets did, to whom, ſay the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was lawful to break ſome one Precept of the Law.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of making any ſuch Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he goes on in the ſame tenor of words,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93550:163"/> and a ſecond time gives himſelf the title of the Son of God, and tells them, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Father did, he might do likewiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 19. That he would raiſe the dead, to prove himſelf equal with God, <hi>That as the Father raiſed up the dead, and quickens them, even ſo the Son quickens whom he will,</hi> v. 21. That that extraordinary Power was given him by his Father, it being his will <hi>that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they did the Father,</hi> v. 23. He proves again that he was the Son of God, by the power he had to raiſe up the dead; <hi>As the Father has life in himſelf, ſo has he given to the Son to have life in himſelf: And has given him authority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man,</hi> v. 26, 27. He applies to himſelf what was ſaid in <hi>Daniel</hi> xii. 2. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reſurrection of the Dead, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth: They that have done good, unto the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of life; and they that have done evil, unto the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> He appeals to <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who had teſtified he was the Son of God, <hi>v.</hi> 33. At laſt he bids them <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> v. 39. in which they would find that he was that Son of Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13, 14. and conſequently equal with God: For who can ſit on God's Throne beſides the true God, as it is declared <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool.</hi> Which words the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> agreeably to other Prophecies, in which he is ſo often called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the Son of God.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:93550:164"/>
               <p>He juſtified his curing Sick People on the Sabbath-day, becauſe he <hi>the Son of man was Lord of the Sabbath.</hi> But how could he be ſo, but becauſe he was that <hi>Word</hi> which had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Law to the <hi>Jews;</hi> that Son of God equal with his Father, who conſequently was Maſter of his own Laws?</p>
               <p>He opened the Eyes of the Blind, and made the Lame to walk, to fulfil the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Iſ.</hi> xxxv. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Behold your God will come, he will come and ſave you; then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unſtopt: Then ſhall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He multiply'd the Loaves in the Deſert, to ſhew that he was that ſame <hi>Word,</hi> to which the <hi>Jews</hi> attributed the Miracle of <hi>Manna</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> He tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, that he was the Bread come down from Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> vi. 51. upon which it may be obſerved that <hi>Philo</hi> maintains that the <hi>Word</hi> was <hi>Manna,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Manna</hi> the Type of the <hi>Word.

               <p>Having wrought ſo many great Miracles before the <hi>Jews,</hi> he askt his Diſciples, what People ſaid and thought of him? To which St. <hi>Peter</hi> anſwering according to the People's various Opinions, and at laſt confeſſing the Faith of himſelf and the other Diſciples, that he was <hi>Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> he commends this Confeſſion in <hi>Peter,</hi> though he had before refuſed to receive it from the Devil; and tells <hi>Peter,</hi> that God, even <hi>his Father, had revealed it to him,</hi> and therefore it muſt be true, <hi>Matth.</hi> xvi. 16, 17. And ſo it was, for God had ſpoken of it by many

               </p>
               <p>He ſhews his Diſciples how <hi>Elijah</hi> was come in the Perſon of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Matt. xvii.

               </p>
               <p>He gives his Diſciples the power of Bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Looſing, that is, of forbidding ſome things which <hi>Moſes</hi> had permitted, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſome which he had forbidden; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſtill to himſelf the power of directing them infallibly by his Spirit in thoſe Acts of their Miniſtry; To ſhew that he was that very God who was to make a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had foretold, <hi>chap.</hi> xxxi. 33. And that he had in him the Authority of a Supream Law-giver. For, who can give Laws to mens Conſciences but the only true God?</p>
               <p>In the Treaſury of the Temple he tells the <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>God was his Father;</hi> that <hi>he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf, but as his Father had taught him,</hi> Joh. viii. 28. <hi>That he had ſpoke that which he had ſeen with his Father,</hi> v. 38. naming thus God, his Father, many times, which no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ever had done, nor no meer Man could do without the higheſt preſumption.</p>

                  <hi>ſhould never ſee death,</hi> v. 51. he made himſelf <hi>greater than Abraham,</hi> v. 53.) That <hi>Abraham had ſeen his day, and was glad,</hi> v. 56. And as they replied, that what he ſaid was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had been dead many hundred years, whereas himſelf <hi>was not yet fifty years old,</hi> v. 57. he anſwers with a repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, before Abraham was, I AM,</hi> v. 58. plainly affirming two things, firſt, that he was the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Soon after he reſtored ſight to one that was born blind, and had this confeſſion from him, which he had before ſuggeſted to him, that he was the Son of God; and accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his Adoration, <hi>Joh.</hi> ix. 35, 38.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, he was <hi>the good Shepherd,</hi> that he <hi>gave his life for the ſheep,</hi> Joh. x. 11.

               </p>
               <p>Being in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Feaſt of the Dedication, the <hi>Jews</hi> deſired him to tell them <hi>plainly</hi> whether he was <hi>Chriſt,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93550:165"/> Joh.</hi> x. 24. To whom he anſwered from <hi>v.</hi> 25. to <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>I told you, and ye believed not. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witneſs of me: But ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, as I ſaid unto you. My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me, is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one. Then the Jews took up ſtones again to ſtone him. Jeſus anſwered them, Many good works have I ſhewed you from my Father, for which of thoſe works do you ſtone me? The Jews anſwered him, ſaying, For a good work we ſtone thee not, but for blaſphemy; and becauſe thou being a man, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thy ſelf God. Jeſus anſwered them, Is it not written in your Law, I ſaid ye are Gods? If he called them Gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; ſay ye of him whom the Father has ſanctified, and ſent into the world, thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God?</hi> It may be obſerved from theſe laſt words, that having been already accus'd of Blaſphemy, becauſe he made himſelf equal with God, not only he affirms it ſtill, but proves it beſides by an Argument from a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer thing to a greater. For, ſays he, If God names Magiſtrates <hi>Elohim,</hi> becauſe they are his Deputies; how much more may his Son be called ſo, whom he has conſecrated and ſent into the World? Alluding to the <hi>Pſalms</hi> ii. and cx. in both which <hi>Pſalms</hi> mention is made of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as the Son of God, and God.</p>

               <p>Some days before his Paſſion he declared that the death of <hi>Lazarus</hi> had happened, <hi>that the Son of God might be glorified thereby,</hi> Joh. xi. 4.

               <p>Having kept his laſt Paſſeover with his Diſciples, he promiſed them the Holy Ghoſt, as another Comforter, <hi>Paraclet,</hi> or <hi>Menahem,</hi> (by which laſt Name the <hi>Jews</hi> mean the <hi>Meſſias</hi>) which ſhews the Holy Ghoſt to be another Perſon. He ſpeaks of this very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, <hi>Joh.</hi> xiv. 16, 17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever: Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſees him not, neither knows him: but you know him, for he dwells with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> xv. 12, 13, 14, 15. He gives the very ſame Notion about him which the <hi>Jews</hi> had.</p>
               <p>He expreſt himſelf ſo plainly concerning his coming from above, that his Diſciples had no further doubts or difficulties about it. <hi>John</hi> xvi. 27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>The Father himſelf loves you, becauſe ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

Jeſus ſaid unto him, <hi>v.</hi> 64. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid: Nevertheleſs I ſay unto you; Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</hi> Upon which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye as a Blaſphemer. From whence it appears what notion the <hi>Jews</hi> had of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And that they believed that Son of man ſpoken of, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13, 14. to be the very Son of God; who had a ſecond Throne ſet for him, and came with the Clouds of Heaven as God: This being the ordinary deſcription the Prophets make of him.</p>
               <p>Being condemned as a Blaſphemer, for taking the Title of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and of the Son of God, the People, by way of mockery, called him the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Son of God, and Saviour; which juſtified his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion. Luke xxiii. 35, 36, 37, 38. <hi>And the people ſtood beholding, and the rulers alſo with them derided him, ſaying, He ſaved others, let him ſave himſelf, if he be Chriſt the choſen of God. And the Souldiers alſo ſaid, If thou be the King of the Jews, ſave thy ſelf. And a ſuperſcription was written over him, This is the King of the Jews.</hi> And <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvii. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. <hi>They that paſſed by reviled him, ſaying, Save thy
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93550:167"/> ſelf: If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs. Likewiſe alſo the Chief Prieſts ſaid, He ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave: If he be the King of Iſrael, let him now come down from the Croſs, and we will believe him. He truſted in God, let him deliver him now, if he will have him; For, he ſaid, I am the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He cried upon the Croſs with a loud voice, <hi>Eli, Eli, Lamma ſabachthani, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me, Mat.</hi> xxvii. 46. Theſe words are the beginning of the 22th. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and very agreeable to thoſe words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. where he that is God himſelf, or the Pſalmiſt for him, does nevertheleſs call the Father his God; ſaying, <hi>O God thy God has anointed thee.</hi> Accordingly the Centurion that guarded him, having heard this Cry, and alſo that with which he expired, ſaying, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit;</hi> ſaid, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God, Mark</hi> xiv. 39.</p>
               <p>After his Death, his ſide was run through, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>Joh.</hi> xix. 37. relating to that Prophecy, <hi>Zech.</hi> xii. 10. which the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood of the Meſſias. [<hi>Breſhit Rabba</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. and <hi>Rabbi Abenezra</hi> on this Text.] And yet the words of that Prophecy come from the mouth of the Lord <hi>Jehovah, Zech.</hi> xii. 1, 4. ſaying, <hi>I will pour upon the Houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the Spirit of grace and ſupplication, and they ſhall look upon ME whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being riſen from the Dead the third day, as he had foretold, the Angel that gave the Women the firſt news of it, called him <hi>Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:93550:168"/> that is, <hi>Jehovah, Mat.</hi> xxviii. 6. as the Angel had done, who gave the Shepherds the tidings of his Birth, <hi>Luk.</hi> ii. 11.</p>
               <p>Soon after, he appeared to his Diſciples, and did conſtitute them Heralds of the New Covenant, which he had made with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in his Blood; of which Covenant <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> is ſaid to be the Author, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxii. 40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them: And I will put my fear in their hearts, they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Afterwards he did promiſe to ſend them the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> xxiv. 46, 47, 48, 49. <hi>He ſaid to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preacht in his name, among all Nations, beginning at Jeruſalem. And ye are witneſſes of theſe things. And behold I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you: But tarry ye in the City of Jeruſalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before his Aſcenſion he gave them Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically the Holy Ghoſt, which he was to ſend fully upon them forty days after, <hi>Joh.</hi> xx. 22. <hi>He breathed on them, and ſaid, receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> not being then preſent, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what others told him, that they had ſeen the Lord Jeſus, Chriſt appear'd to him, and ſo throughly ſatisfied him of the truth of his Reſurrection, that thereupon he remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly owned him his <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>God, v.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>He bids them Baptize in the Name of the Trinity, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvii. 18, 19, 20. <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth, Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:93550:168"/> the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you. And lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the World.</hi> In which words he viſibly relates to many Perſons, and where he repreſents himſelf as the <hi>Shekinah</hi> that was always with the people under his conduct.</p>
               <p>Being ready to go up into Heaven, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Adorations, <hi>Luk.</hi> xxiv. 51, 52. <hi>While he bleſt them he was parted from them, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into Heaven: And they worſhipt him, and returned to Jeruſalem with great joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And St. <hi>John</hi> declares that the end for which he writ his Goſpel, was, <hi>That we might believe, that Jeſus is Chriſt the Son of God; and that believing we might have life through his Name, Joh.</hi> xx. 31.</p>
               <p>I thought it neceſſary, thus in ſhort, to ſum up the chief Particulars which the <hi>Four Evangeliſts</hi> have obſerved about the Life of our Saviour. To ſhew plainly and briefly to the Reader, that the Goſpel follows the ſame Notions which the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> had given of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and which the <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's days had generally received. Firſt, That in the Divine Nature there is a Father, a Son, and a Holy Ghoſt. Secondly, That the Son, which was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> Thirdly, That the Holy Ghoſt was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and to come, being ſent both by the Father and the Son, as the Son was ſent by the Father to ſave the World.</p>
               <p>This is a Subject of moment; our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are Men of Parts and Wit. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93550:169"/> to rid themſelves of all Difficulties in theſe Myſteries, they maintain that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel propoſes only this one fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, <hi>That Jeſus, as man, is the Meſſias.</hi> It will be convenient to add to what has been obſerved out of the Goſpels, ſome more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations drawn from the Writings of the Apoſtles, and the firſt Chriſtian Writers, to ſhew what Notions they had of theſe things: Namely, the very ſame which are expreſt in the Goſpels, and were then acknowledged by the <hi>Jews.</hi>

               <p>IT being of great moment to ſhew that the Apoſtles did not make a new Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form out of their own heads, when they Preached the Goſpel; I will examin ſeveral Hypotheſes of <hi>Philo,</hi> which the Apoſtles did follow in their Doctrine and ordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, when they ſpoke of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> maintains that the Ideas of the World were in the <hi>Word</hi> of God; therefore he calls him the Vertue which made the World, which came out of the True Good, as its Original. <hi>De Opif. p.</hi> 3, 4, 5.</p>

That it is the <hi>Word</hi> of him who is not begotten, which made all things. <hi>Lib. de Sacr. Abel. pag.</hi> 109. That he is the Wiſdom which created all things, and that the Wiſdom is the Word; manifeſtly alluding to the 3d. and 8th. <hi>chap.</hi>

               <p>And theſe very things are taught by St. <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> ii. and <hi>Heb.</hi> i. and by St. <hi>John</hi> in the firſt <hi>chap.</hi> of his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> affirms that the <hi>Word</hi> of God governs the World. <hi>Lib. de Cherub. p.</hi> 87. <hi>F. G. Lib. de Agric. pag.</hi> 152. And he affirms according to the Notion which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. that he preſides over the Revolutions which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Kingdoms. <hi>Lib. Quod Deus ſit Immut. p.</hi> 248.</p>
               <p>And this very thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 2, 3. where he ſays, he is <hi>the heir of all things,</hi> and <hi>upholds all things;</hi> that is, guides and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> ſays, that the Eternal <hi>Word</hi> appeared to <hi>Abraham. Lib. de Sacrif. Abel. pag.</hi> 108. And elſe where he names that Angel or Word <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah. Lib. de Confuſ. Ling. pag.</hi> 290.

               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> maintains that Wiſdom (which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him is the ſame with the Word) was the Rock in the Wilderneſs. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Alleg.

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93550:170"/> That he created the Voice which was heard by the <hi>Jews, Lib. de Decal. pag.</hi> 577. <hi>F.</hi> And this very thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 25, 26. where he ſuppoſes that Chriſt uttered that <hi>Voice</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>

                  <hi>R.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe very Expreſſions St. <hi>John</hi> has follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ch.</hi> 1. becauſe the Meſſias was to be God indeed; becauſe he was that <hi>Jehovah</hi> who had <hi>gone before Iſrael, Exod.</hi> xiii. 21. whom the <hi>Jews</hi> affirm to have been the <hi>Word,</hi> as we obſerved before.</p>
               <p>If any one deſires to know how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles came to apply to the Meſſias thoſe things which the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood of God's <hi>Word.:</hi> He may for his ſatisfaction obſerve the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> owns that the <hi>Word</hi> was the Eternal Son of God, <hi>Lib. Quod Deus ſit Immut. p.</hi> 232. <hi>F. G.</hi> But withal that this Eternal <hi>Word</hi> is ſpoken of <hi>Zech.</hi> v. 12. <hi>Behold the Man whoſe name is the Branch,</hi> or <hi>the Eaſt</hi> acccording to the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation, <hi>Ibid.</hi> He calls him the firſt-born, and the Creator of the World, <hi>Lib. de Confuſ. Ling. pag.</hi> 258.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Jews</hi> did unanimouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that place of <hi>Zechary</hi> of the Meſſias, as
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93550:171"/> appears by their <hi>Targum,</hi> by their moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Midraſhim,</hi> and by the conſent of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Abarbanel,</hi> who confutes <hi>R. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon Jarchi,</hi> by whom they were applied to <hi>Zorobabel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſo, what could be more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for the Apoſtles, than to teach that the Meſſias was to be that Eternal <hi>Word;</hi> and that that <hi>Word</hi> was to appear as the true Meſſias?</p>
               <p>Another Ground upon which they applied to the Meſſias what the Old <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood of the <hi>Word</hi> was this: The Old <hi>Jews</hi> did own that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which guided the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Deſert, was their Shepherd. <hi>Philo de Agric. pag.</hi> 152. From whence they concluded that the 23d. Pſalm, <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd,</hi> was to be underſtood of the Meſſias, <hi>Phil. de Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. Nom. pag.</hi> 822, 823.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles therefore did of courſe apply to the <hi>Word,</hi> as him who was to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, thoſe Propheſies which mention the Meſſias as the Shepherd, whom God was to ſend to his people. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xl. 10, 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxiv. 11, 12. and <hi>ch.</hi> xxxiv. 24. <hi>Mich.</hi> ii. 12. <hi>Zech.</hi> xiii. 7. For all theſe places are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Meſſias, by the Ancient Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes, and by the <hi>Midraſhim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Old <hi>Jews</hi> did own that that <hi>Word</hi> was God, that he had made the World; and that he was to be the promiſed Meſſias. Upon this Ground the Apoſtles applied to the Meſſias thoſe places of the Old Teſtament, which ſay that <hi>Jehovah</hi> made Heaven and Earth, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. where he applys to Jeſus Chriſt, as the confeſſed Meſſias, the words of <hi>Pſal.</hi> cii. 26.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:93550:171"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> affirms that the <hi>Word</hi> was the true and Eternal Prieſt, <hi>Lib. de Profug. pag.</hi> 364, 365. That it was he that divided the Victims, when he appeared to <hi>Abraham, Lib. Quis divin. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum haer. pag.</hi> 390. <hi>A.</hi> 399. and 401. That he is God's Prieſt, <hi>Lib. de Somn. p.</hi> 463.</p>
               <p>From this common Doctrine it was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to conclude that the Meſſias being the ſame with the <hi>Word,</hi> was to be the High Prieſt of the New Teſtament, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains it at large in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> ſays that the <hi>Word</hi> is Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, <hi>Lib. Quis divin. rer. haer. pag.</hi> 398. <hi>A.</hi> That he makes Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God, <hi>Lib. de Somniis, p.</hi> 447. <hi>E.F.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this it was eaſie to ſee that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias was to be indued with a Noble Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, eſpecially <hi>David</hi> having mentioned it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. repreſenting the Meſſias, whom the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Paraphraſe often calls the <hi>Word</hi> of God, as being a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec.</hi> And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms likewiſe in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> ſays that God having appeared by the <hi>Word</hi> to the Patriarchs, and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpoke by the ſame Word to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and that he was the Prince of Angels, <hi>Lib. Quis rer. divin. haer. pag.</hi> 397. <hi>F. G.</hi> And the Light and the Doctor of his people, <hi>Lib. de Somn. pag.</hi> 448. calling the <hi>Word</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It was therefore but agreeably to theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the Apoſtles applied to the Meſſias, thoſe places of the Old Teſtament, where God promiſed to ſpeak to his new people, by the Meſſias, as <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 15, 16. which St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

               <p>It is neceſſary to take notice of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Old <hi>Jews:</hi> Firſt, that we may well underſtand the reaſon for which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles quoted ſeveral places as relating to the Meſſias, which are meant of <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That we may ſee for what reaſon, they ſuppoſed, as a thing owned by the <hi>Jews,</hi> for whom they writ, that thoſe places related to the Meſſias, though the <hi>Jews</hi> applied them to the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>What I ſaid of the Apoſtles, and the other Writers of the New Teſtament, that they exactly followed the Doctrines of the Old <hi>Jews,</hi> which followed the Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Old Teſtament, may juſtly be ſaid of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and of thoſe who both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after him writ in defenſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Divinity. I need not quote many of them, to ſhew that they went upon the ſame Grounds with the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:93550:172"/>
               <p>It will be enough to examine <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; for, he diſputed with a <hi>Jew,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no other Scripture beſides the Old Teſtament, and therefore he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, but by the Authority of thoſe Books. And if his method be well examined, it will be found that he argues all along as the Apoſtles did; <hi>viz.</hi> from the ſenſe received by the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſuppoſing that ſuch and ſuch places of Scripture, from which he draws conſequences, were applied to the Meſſias by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtin</hi> having proved that nothing certain can be learned from Philoſophy, by <hi>Plato</hi>'s example, who entertained groſs Errors about the Nature of God, and of the Soul: And declared that he came to the knowledg of the Truth only by the help of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. He affirms in general that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion which he had imbraced, is all grounded upon the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. He does particularly inſtance in that of our Saviour's Perſon and Office, though the <hi>Jews</hi> lookt upon it as impious, that Chriſtians, as they reckoned, truſted in a Man Crucified.</p>
               <p>He lays for foundation, that the Scripture ſpeaks of two Comings of Chriſt; the one indeed Glorious, mentioned, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxxii. But to be preceded by another altogether mean and deſpicable, as <hi>David</hi> had alſo foretold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. at the end.</p>
               <p>He maintains that the Meſſias is clearly deſcribed as God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlvii. where he is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Lord, our King,</hi> and <hi>the King of all the Earth. Pſal.</hi> xxiv. where he is called <hi>the Lord
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93550:173"/> ſtrong and mighty,</hi> and <hi>the King of Glory.</hi> Pſal. xcix. where it is ſaid that he <hi>ſpoke</hi> to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites in the cloudy Pillar.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. where he is named <hi>God's anointed, the Lord God,</hi> and propoſed as the object of our Adoration.</p>
               <p>He affirms that Chriſt was to be God, and though the ſame in nature, yet a different perſon from him who made Heaven and Earth: He proves by the ſeveral Apparitions, where a true God is mentioned, appearing to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Mamre, Gen.</hi> xviii. 1. To <hi>Jacob</hi> in a Dream, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxi. with whom he wreſtled in the figure of a Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxii. and aſſiſted him in his Journey to <hi>Padan Aram.</hi> And to <hi>Moſes</hi> he appeared in the Burning-buſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> iii.</p>
               <p>He maintains that he was to be God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he executed the Counſel of God: Hence he is named by <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Prince of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and an Angel which is the Lord. And becauſe the Scripture deſcribes him as begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God, and called the Son, the Wiſdom of God, and the Word, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii.</p>
               <p>He affirms that God ſpoke to the Word, when he ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man in our image, Gen.</hi> i. 26. And, <hi>Behold the Man is become as one of us, Gen.</hi> iii. 22. which alſo clearly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a Plurality.</p>
               <p>He proves from <hi>Pſal.</hi> ii. <hi>This day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee;</hi> that his Generation is from all Eternity.</p>
               <p>And from <hi>Pſal.</hi> xv. that the Church ought to adore Chriſt, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>He is thy Lord, worſhip thou him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He repeats the ſame things towards the end of his Dialogue, where he proves that the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93550:173"/> Meſſias appeared to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> vi. 2. To <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> xxxii. 30. To <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> xviii. 16, 17. To <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> xi. 3. and <hi>Deut.</hi> iii. 18. and to all the Patriarchs and Prophets.</p>
               <p>He prevents an Objection, (that this was not a Perſon, but a Vertue from the Father, which is called ſometimes an Angel, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his Glory, ſometimes a Man, ſometimes the <hi>Word.</hi>) By ſhewing that the Scripture makes out firſt a real diſtinction between the Son and the Father, as between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>Jehovah, Gen.</hi> xix. 24. 2ly, a true Plurality, as <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 22. the <hi>Man is become as one of Us.</hi> 3ly, a true Filiation, as <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. whence he concludes, that he that is begotten is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from him who begot him.</p>
               <p>He anſwers Mr. <hi>N.</hi>'s Objection, borrowed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who quote thoſe words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where God ſays, <hi>He will not give his Glory to another.</hi> By ſaying that the Son is the Glory of the Father, and that in this reſpect he is not another Being from him. Theſe words have another ſenſe in the <hi>Targum,</hi> but which ſeems an addition. For they are thus rendered, <hi>I will not give my Glory to another Nation:</hi> That is, my <hi>Shekinah</hi> ſhall not go from the <hi>Jews</hi> to another people.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not mention here that which relates to our Saviour's Office, eſpecially his eſtate of Humiliation, which <hi>Juſtin</hi> proves by Texts taken out of the Old Teſtament. I ſhall only obſerve: 1ſt. That he quotes all the places of Scripture which he uſes, as relating to the Meſſias by the confeſſion of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and thus he ſhews by the circumſtances of thoſe
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93550:174"/> places, which had obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> to apply them to the promiſed Meſſias.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That he confutes the falſe Explications which the <hi>Jews</hi> gave to many places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for inſtance that which underſtands (<hi>Iſa.</hi> ix.) of King <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> for this miſtake was older than <hi>Juſtin;</hi> ſome <hi>Jews</hi> in his days had revived it, and the Author of it was not <hi>Rabbi Hillel,</hi> who lived after <hi>Juſtin,</hi> but he made himſelf famous by propagating it. That <hi>Rabbi</hi> by the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> having loſt all hopes of the Meſſias whom God had promiſed them, made this a Maxim, <hi>There is to be no Meſſias in Iſrael, becauſe they had him in the days of Hezekiah King of Judah.</hi> Gemara ad Sanhedr. cap. Chelek.</p>
               <p>It may be Mr. <hi>N.</hi> will be ſomething diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the method which <hi>Juſtin</hi> uſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he advanced nothing new againſt <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> who probably was that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>R. Tarphon,</hi> ſo often mentioned in the <hi>Miſhnah,</hi> but whoſe Name the latter <hi>Jews</hi> have corrupted. But I will if poſſible go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to convince him, and prevent all his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. To that end I will make it appear that moſt places of Scripture which <hi>Juſtin</hi> uſed, were objected to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians before <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Birth. I prove it thus. <hi>Juſtin</hi> was born at ſooneſt 105. years after Chriſt. But it appears by the Teſtimony of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that long before, their Doctors were divided amongſt themſelves about the manner in which thoſe Objections were to be anſwered, which the Chriſtians made to them, drawn from the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:93550:174"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Eliezer,</hi> who lived under <hi>Trajan,</hi> had this Maxim, <hi>Study the Law with diligence, that thou mayſt be able to anſwer the Epicureans.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>R. Jochanan</hi> explains that Maxim of <hi>R. Eliezer,</hi> as regarding not only Heathens, but chiefly the <hi>Jews</hi> who had renounced their Religion. And who could theſe Apoſtate <hi>Jews</hi> be? It is eaſie to gueſs, by the Objections which they made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by the Maxim which <hi>R. Jochanan</hi> propoſes, to prevent the <hi>Jews</hi> from being overſeen in their diſputes with theſe <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, they were Chriſtians, who proved that there was a Plurality, and a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in the Divine Nature; Alledging to this effect againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> thoſe places out of the Law and of the Prophets, where mention is made of God in the Plural Number.</p>

               <p>Theſe nine Arguments the Chriſtians made uſe of to prove a Plurality in the Godhead. And we find that they were grounded upon the exact quotation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, not the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion. For the <hi>Greek</hi> leaves room only to few of theſe remarks, which ſhews that <hi>Juſtin,</hi> who was born a Heathen, had them from Men bred among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had read the Bible in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and had made their Obſervations upon the Original Text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and other Sacred Writers.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Beth Iſra. Ibid.</note>If a Man ſhould ask, how ancient were thoſe Objections about a Plurality in God. I anſwer that they were as old as the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> For, <hi>R. Meir, R. Akiba</hi>'s Maſter, had endeavoured to anſwer in his Sermons the Objection taken out of <hi>Gen.</hi> xix. 24. now <hi>R. Meir</hi> was born under <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Akiba</hi> died in <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s days, about 120. years after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Neither were the <hi>Jews</hi> agreed in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of anſwering thoſe Objections, about a Plurality in the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. They thought they might anſwer moſt of them by this general Maxim, That God never did any thing without conſulting with his Family above, that is, the Angels. And this they pretended to prove by theſe words, <hi>Dan.</hi> iv. 17. <hi>This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ones.</hi> Which anſwer was deſtroyed by what others ſaid, that God ſpoke of himſelf in the Plural Number; that <hi>Moſes</hi> did alſo ſpeak of God, they having regard to his Sovereign dignity. Though at the ſame time they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that in thoſe places, <hi>Moſes</hi> joined a
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93550:175"/> Verb in the Singular with that Noun in the Plural, to aſſert the Unity of God, and for fear the Reader ſhould think there were many Gods. Thus when Men diſpute againſt the Truth, what one of them builds up, is preſently pulled down by another.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. They were alſo divided about the <hi>Thrones ſet, Dan.</hi> vii. 9. For to what purpoſe many Thrones? if there were but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?<note place="margin">Beth. Iſr. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>R. Akiba</hi> maintained that there was one for God, and another for <hi>David.</hi> He ſeems by <hi>David</hi> to have underſtood the Meſſias. But <hi>R. Joſe</hi> lookt upon this as impious, and affirmed that one of theſe Thrones was ſet for God's Juſtice, the other for his Mercy. <hi>R. Akiba</hi> was at laſt convinced, and received this explication, which <hi>R. Eliezer</hi> Son of <hi>Azaria</hi> hearing, was ſo far from approving of, that he ſent away <hi>Akiba</hi> with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and told him, <hi>Why doſt thou meddle with expounding the Scripture? Go to the army and fight;</hi> this he ſaid, becauſe <hi>Akiba</hi> had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Barcosba.</hi> As for <hi>R. Eliezer</hi> himſelf, he ſaid that theſe two Thrones ſignified only that there was one for God, and a footſtool to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. They were hard put to it by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections drawn from <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii. 21. about that Angel whom God had promiſed to guide <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in whom God's Name was to be, and who is called by the <hi>Jews, Metatron.</hi> For, ſaid the Chriſtians, If the name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> was in him, he was to be adored. This the <hi>Jews</hi> evaded by altering the Text, and reading with the LXX. <hi>Thou ſhalt not rebell againſt him;</hi> or, <hi>Thou ſhalt not change me with him;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>for him.</hi> When the Chriſtians objected
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93550:176"/> that this Angel muſt needs be God, becauſe God ſaid of him, he ſhall not pardon thy tranſgreſſions, and the property of God is to forgive ſins, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did object to Chriſt; They anſwered, This is our opinion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we did not receive him as Ambaſſador.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. In time they took this prudent method in their diviſions, they forbad their people to diſpute with Chriſtians upon thoſe Subjects, unleſs they were well uſed to the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; <hi>Let him diſpute with Hereticks, that can anſwer them;</hi> as <hi>R. Idith. But if a man can't an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, let him forbear diſputing.</hi> This was the Counſel or Law of <hi>Rab. Nachman,</hi> one of the Authors cited in the <hi>Ghemara, de Sanhedrin, ch.</hi> 4. §. 11. In <hi>Beth Iſrael.</hi> For, <hi>R. Eliezer,</hi> who lived under <hi>Trajan,</hi> had obſerved that the reading of the Old Teſtament made the <hi>Jews</hi> turn Hereticks: <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſtians; Himſelf was ſuſpected to be inclinable that way.

And this (I hope) will ſerve to ſhew that the Apoſtles did advance nothing but what was commonly received by the Learned Men of the Synagogue, and that they have offered no violence to the Sacred Context of the Old Teſtament, but that they quoted it according to its natural ſenſe; thoſe <hi>very Ideas</hi> being common till this day among the Learned <hi>Jews,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe very Men who applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fully to the Studies of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are lookt upon as the <hi>Keepers and Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi> of Tradition.

               <p>If any one would know why St. <hi>Matthew, ch.</hi> ii. 18. has quoted the words of <hi>Jeremy, ch.</hi> xxxi. 15. <hi>Rachel weeping for her children becauſe they were not.</hi> He may conceive the reaſon of ſuch a quotation, if he knows that the <hi>Jews</hi> do look upon the Meſſias as the ſervant which is ſpoken of by <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> liii.

What has been ſaid ſhews ſufficiently that the firſt Chriſtians followed exactly the ſteps of the Apoſtles, and that the Apoſtles and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf followed exactly the Notions of the ancient Synagogue.</p>

               <head type="sub">An Anſwer to ſome Exceptions taken from Expreſſions uſed in the Goſpel.</head>
               <p>WHat has been ſaid about the Notions which the Writers of the Goſpels, the Apoſtles and the firſt Chriſtians had of the Meſſias, ſhews plainly that they were the ſame that were then common among the <hi>Jews.</hi> But becauſe ſome Objections are made againſt what has been ſaid, I will for the ſatisfaction of the Reader, examine thoſe which ſeem moſt material, and might preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice which I have already eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The firſt is raiſed from our Saviour's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions when he ſpeaks of himſelf: It is that which St. <hi>Chryſoſtome T.</hi> i. <hi>Hom.</hi> 32. obſerves, that although Chriſt declared himſelf to be God, (as appears by his way of ſpeaking all along) and named himſelf the Son of God; yet he never actually took upon him the Name or Title of God, while he lived upon Earth. Which ſeems very ſtrange, for there was great reaſon to expect that he ſhould have expreſt himſelf more clearly upon ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an Article, on which the Authority of the Chriſtian Religion does depend.</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, that Chriſt uſed that cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for fear of deſtroying in the opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> the reality of his humane Nature. Had he ſaid plainly, I, am God, the <hi>Jews</hi> who in their Scriptures were ſo much uſed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:93550:183"/> to Divine Appearances, might have had juſt Grounds of doubting the truth of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Word.</hi> They had lookt upon his Fleſh as a Phantaſm; which perſuaſion of theirs would have deſtroyed the Notion of his Humane Nature. Therefore to perſuade them of the truth of his Humane Nature, he was born as other Men are, he grew by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as other Men do, he ſuffered hunger and thirſt, was ſubject to wearineſs, and to all the other infirmities incident to a real Man; growing even in Knowledg and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by degrees, as other Men do. It was abſolutely neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, becauſe he was to be <hi>like his Brethren in all things, ſin only excepted,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, applying to him that place of <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxii. where the Meſſias ſays, he would <hi>declare the Name of God to his Brethren;</hi> and of <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. 7. where he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his <hi>fellows:</hi> And alſo becauſe he was to be the ſeed of the woman ſpoken of, <hi>Geneſis</hi> iii. 15.</p>
               <p>And if, for all theſe real marks, his being a true Man, ſome Hereticks called the <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians,</hi> believed his Body to have been only a Phantaſm, without any reality. And others, named the <hi>Apollinarians,</hi> affirmed that the <hi>Word</hi> ſupplied in Chriſt the functions of a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul, though he had really no ſuch Soul; Had Chriſt expreſly ſtiled himſelf God, he had given the <hi>Jews</hi> and Hereticks occaſion of fancying that his Humane Nature was not a reality; but that this laſt Apparition of God in a Humane Body, was like the old ones, when God appeared in the form of a Man, and wreſtled with <hi>Jacob,</hi> though it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93550:183"/> a true Incarnation, the thing being done by a Body made of Air on purpoſe, or by the Body of a real Man, but borrowed only for the time, and preſently after put off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let it be conſidered that Chriſt uſed that caution, that he might not give the utmoſt provocation to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were much offended to ſee him in ſo mean a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For, though they might perhaps have owned ſuch a deſpicable Man to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, yet they could by no means own him to be the Meſſias, of whom they expected that he ſhould be a Temporal and a great King. Therefore they could hardly bear our Saviour's diſcourſe about the Dignity of his Perſon; they took up ſtones to throw at him, when he told them he was greater than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and before <hi>Abraham, Joh.</hi> viii. They ſaid he had a Devil, when he told them he had power to raiſe himſelf from the dead, and alſo thoſe who did believe in him. How then could they have heard from him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs declaration, that he was God, Maker of Heaven and Earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It muſt be alſo obſerved that there being many Prophecies, by the fulfilling of which the Meſſias was to be known; Chriſt declared himſelf by degrees, and fulfilled thoſe Prophecies one after another, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might have a competent time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every particular. To this end he did for ſome years Preach the Goſpel; He wrought his Miracles at ſeveral times, and in ſeveral places; He wrought ſuch and ſuch Miracles, and not others; imitating herein the Sun, which by degrees appears and enlightens the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:93550:184"/> World. This might eaſily be ſhewn more at large, but that the thing is plain to any that have attentively read the Goſpel. What I have noted is ſufficient to ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt was not to aſſume the Name of God in the time of his Humiliation, although he hath done the equivalent in ſo many places, where he ſpeaks of himſelf as of the Son of God, the <hi>Memra,</hi> the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, who is God. 2ly. That it was more fit for him to let it be concluded from his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Miniſtry of the Meſſias as it was by <hi>Thomas, Joh.</hi> xx. 18. Not that they knew then and not before that he was he from whom Life, and an Eternal Life ſhould be expected: Upon which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeems to Ground his Godhead <hi>in h. l.</hi> but becauſe then they ſaw in him a full demonſtration that he was the true God, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from whom the Life of all Creatures is derived, as is ſaid <hi>Joh.</hi> i.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Objection is taken from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which St. <hi>John</hi> has uſed in the firſt Chapter of his Goſpel, to denote our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Divinity. For if we hear the <hi>Unitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Firſt, it is not clear that any other of the Writers of the New Teſtament has uſed it in that ſenſe. And then, the Notion of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſeems to be grounded only on the <hi>Greek</hi> Expreſſions, and not on the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, as it is uſed in the Original of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>To anſwer that Objection, I muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, 1. That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the <hi>Jews</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt, to expreſs the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> that is, the Angel of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:93550:184"/> the Covenant. So we ſee in the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> chap. xviii. 15. <hi>Omnipotens ſermo,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>tuus de coelo à regalibus ſedibus durus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellator;</hi> and ſo in ſome other places of the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> as <hi>chap.</hi> i. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>I know that <hi>Grotius</hi> pretends upon the place of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there ſignifies a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Angel; and quotes <hi>Philo</hi> to confirm his Explication. But I maintain that no body but <hi>Grotius</hi> could have advanced ſuch a falſe Explication, and be ſo bold as to quote <hi>Philo</hi> for it, whoſe Teſtimonies which I have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, are ſo clearly againſt him, and diſtinguiſh ſo exactly the Angels from the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I pray the Reader only to remark this, that if the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies here a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, then it was the current Notion of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; ſo that when St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in his firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either 'twas only his meaning that ſuch a created Angel was made Fleſh, and the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſt Jews</hi> could not underſtand it otherwiſe; or St. <hi>John</hi> was to explain the ſenſe of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> according to a new, an unknown, and unheard ſignification; that he never did, and ſo he help'd the <hi>Arians,</hi> and confounded the Orthodox.</p>
               <p>Some body will perhaps excuſe <hi>Grotius,</hi> who ſaith in the Preface to his Annotations upon this Book, that ſuch a piece hath been inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Chriſtian, who hath fobb'd in many other things; and it was the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> in his Judgment of the Fathers. But <hi>Grotius,</hi> who believes the Works of <hi>Philo</hi> true, hath ſhut that Door againſt this Evaſion, when he
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:93550:185"/> confirms the truth of that Saying of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, by the Authority of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew;</hi> and 'tis ſo ſtrange an Accuſation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground, that it came in no body's head before <hi>Grotius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly. I anſwer, That according to St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi>'s meaning, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> v. 8. <hi>Ye have not the Word of God remaining in you.</hi> And 'tis true that it cannot be underſtood of the Law and Prophecy, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms to have been truſted to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation. And 'tis mighty probable that St. <hi>John</hi> taking the <hi>Shekinah</hi> and the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for the ſame, ſaith that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Abſence from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had rejected his direction and conduct.</p>
               <p>I anſwer 3dly. That many of the Ancient Doctors of the Church did remark, that St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Luk. i. 2. Acts i. and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. iv. 12. uſed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the ſame ſenſe, to denote the Second Perſon of the Trinity; and that therefore it was not peculiar to St. <hi>John</hi> to do ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. I ſay that the word <hi>Davar,</hi> in the room of which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity do ever uſe that of <hi>Memra,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Second Perſon of the Trinity, was in uſe even in <hi>David</hi>'s time; as appears by <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. where the LXX have render'd it by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which Verſion being common among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and generally received, St. <hi>John</hi> could not uſe a term more proper to expreſs the Divinity of the Second Perſon taking our Nature upon him. And if it is no matter of wonder, that the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93550:185"/> ſhould give to our Saviour the Name of the Meſſias, or that of the Son of God, which were firſt given him by <hi>David;</hi> it ought to be none, that St. <hi>John</hi> has given him that of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which likewiſe was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by <hi>David;</hi> and does withal ſo well expreſs the Author of the Creation, who was this very <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, who ſaid <hi>Let</hi> ſuch or ſuch a thing be, and <hi>it was:</hi> For which reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that God made the Worlds by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 2. and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt. chap.</hi> iii. 5. where he aſcribes the Creation of the World to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Word, as it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Grotius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why St. <hi>John</hi> is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in his Expreſſions about the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom he makes to be the Creator of the Worlds, and then repreſents as being made Man; was becauſe the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts had given ſo full an Account of his Birth, and Genealogy, and every thing elſe that was needful to prove the Truth of his Human Nature againſt the <hi>Simoniani</hi> and other Hereticks, that would make him a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm; that this Evangeliſt found himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be the more expreſs in aſſerting his Divinity, againſt the <hi>Ebïonites,</hi> who abuſed ſome places of the other Goſpels, to maintain that Chriſt was a mere Man; and againſt the <hi>Cerinthians,</hi> who affirmed that the <hi>Word</hi> was not inſeparably united to the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, St. <hi>John</hi> uſed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to expreſs the Unity of God, tho there be Three Perſons in the Divine Nature: Therefore he ſays that the <hi>Word</hi> was with God, and that he was God. He obſerves that Chriſt ſaid
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:93550:186"/> that he was in the Father, and the Father in him: That he and the Father were one; as he had before expreſs'd himſelf in his firſt <hi>Epiſt.</hi> chap. v. 7. <hi>Theſe Three are One;</hi> to ſhew the Unity of the Divine Monarchy, after the manner in which the <hi>Jews</hi> did apprehend it; wherein he was followed by the firſt Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Another Objection, which ſeems very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and therefore is confidently made by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> is grounded upon thoſe places in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, where they attribute to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> what is affirmed in Scripture to have been ſaid or done by an Angel, in very many Apparitions; as <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 2. and <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 30. where St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> after <hi>Moſes,</hi> affirms that <hi>the Angel of the Lord appeared to Moſes in the buſh:</hi> In which places of Scripture, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Angel, not the Son of God, ſeems to have appeared to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers take this Angel to have been the <hi>Word,</hi> as I ſhewed before. Which Miſtake muſt invalidate their Teſtimony in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, ſome Interpreters, as <hi>Lorinus</hi> the Jeſuit, and others Papiſts, ſuppoſe him to have been a created Angel, but which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Perſon of the Son of God, and therefore acted in his Name, and ſpoke as if he had been the Lord himſelf. This Opinion they ground upon two things: Firſt, Becauſe he is expreſly diſtinguiſh'd from the Lord, both by <hi>Moſes</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who call him the Angel of the Lord. And Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Son of God never took upon him the Nature of Angels, as he did that of Men; and therefore can't be called by their Name.</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:93550:186"/>
               <p>This has been thoroughly conſidered before, to which I might refer the Reader for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But to ſave him trouble, we ſhall here ſhew him reaſon enough to believe that thoſe Texts ſpeak of one that was more than a Creature. Firſt, Becauſe the Angel is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently named the <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah,</hi> both by <hi>Moſes</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> even as <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxi. the Angel which wreſtled with <hi>Jacob</hi> is called <hi>God.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe he declared formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was the Lord, when he ſaid to <hi>Moſes, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob;</hi> which can never be ſaid of a mere Creature, under whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Commiſſion or Dignity.</p>
               <p>The Prophets did formerly repreſent God, and they acted as well as ſpake in his Name; but for all this they never ſpoke as the Angel mentioned by St. <hi>Stephen:</hi> They ſaid barely, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah, I am God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe Chriſt repreſented his Father, as being his Ambaſſador and his Deputy; and yet he never took the Name of Father. We read of many Apparitions of Angels in the New Teſtament, yet no man can pretend to ſhew that any of them either ſpoke or acted as God, though ſent by him, and ſpeaking to Men in his Name. It had been as abſurd and as great a crime for them to have done ſo, as for a Viceroy, to tell the People whom he is ſent to govern, I am your King, tho' he does repreſent the King's Perſon.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Angel mentioned by St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> is named the Angel of the Lord; and as true that Chriſt did not take the nature of Angels on him. He did this favour only to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:93550:187"/> Men; for them only he humbled himſelf, and was made like them in all things, ſin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and for this reaſon he is truly named Man, and the Son of Man, as well as the Son of God. For Apoſtate Angels he forſook them, and left them for ever in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be obſerved that the word <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> ſignifies properly a Meſſenger, and denotes rather the Office than the nature of thoſe bleſſed Spirits, ſent forth to Miniſter. And conſequently their Name may well be given to the Son of God, who ever had the care of the Church committed to him, and by whom the Father has communed with Man ever ſince his fall into ſin.</p>
               <p>Upon this Ground <hi>Malachi, ch.</hi> iii. <hi>v.</hi> 1. names the Son of God the <hi>Angel,</hi> or <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Covenant.</hi> Which Prophecy is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this day by the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſpeak of the Meſſias. <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> lxiii. <hi>v.</hi> 9. names him <hi>the Angel</hi> of the Preſence of the Lord, who ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and redeemed the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> According to what the Lord ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> xxiii. 23. <hi>My Angel ſhall go before thee.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiii. 14. <hi>My preſence ſhall go with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Primitive Chriſtians never doubted, but that the Angel which appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Deſart, and guided the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was the Son of God: St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays expreſly thus much, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 9. when he affirms that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> tempted Chriſt in the Wilderneſs, by their Rebellions. <hi>Lorinus</hi> himſelf, quoting ſome places from the moſt Ancient Fathers, is forced to acknowledge it on <hi>Acts</hi> vii. And I ſhewed before, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has affirmed
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:93550:187"/> nothing upon this Point, but according to the common Notion of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ought not therefore to ſeem ſtrange, that St. <hi>Stephen</hi> does diſtinguiſh the Angel of whom he ſpeaks, from the Lord himſelf, when he names him the Angel of the Lord: For the Son is diſtinct from the Father, and the Son was ſent by the Father: But becauſe they ſo partake of the ſame Divine Nature, that they are in reality but one and the ſame God, bleſſed for ever; the Son in this regard might well ſay, <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. and be called <hi>the Lord Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be askt why <hi>Moſes</hi> did rather call him an Angel, than otherwiſe. I anſwer, that he did ſo, for theſe two reaſons: Firſt, becauſe the diſtinction of the Divine Perſons was not ſo clearly revealed under the Old Teſtament, by reaſon that it did not ſo well ſuit that Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comy. Secondly, becauſe God ſince he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the World, commonly imploying Angels in thoſe works which were not above their power and capacity; It may very well be that the Son of God, when he appeared to Men, uſed the Miniſtry of Angels, either to form the voice and the words which he ſpoke to his Prophets, or to make the Body or the Figure under which he appeared.</p>
               <p>It is objected in the laſt place, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ſuppoſe, that an Angel gave the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and not the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the Son of God; and that that Angel is called God, becauſe he ſpoke in God's Name. Thus <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 19. he ſays that the Law was ordained by Angels. <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 2. that it was ſpoken <hi>by Angels.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 1, 2. making
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:93550:188"/> oppoſition between the Law and the Goſpel, he ſays to elevate this laſt above the former, that God having formerly ſpoke to Men <hi>by his Prophets,</hi> has in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by <hi>his Son:</hi> which could not be true, if he had before made uſe of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to give his Law to the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> look upon this Argument as unanſwerable. And the truth is, it has impoſed upon many Learned Writers, as <hi>Lorinus, Grotius,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>But it will be no difficult buſineſs to anſwer it, if it be obſerved: Firſt, that it hath been always the opinion of the old <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Law was given by <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was likewiſe their opinion, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> who gave the Law was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And 3ly, that 'tis affirmed by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> xxxiii. 2. <hi>That when the Lord came from Sinai, and roſe up from Seir, He came with ten thouſands of Saints; from his right hand went a fiery Law.</hi> I ſay that 'tis enough to prove thoſe three things, to convince any Man that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays that the Law was ſpoken by Angels, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he means only that they were preſent, as witneſſes where it was given; not that they repreſented God's perſon.</p>
               <p>The firſt appears by <hi>Philo,</hi> who affirms that it was God who ſpoke, when he gave the Law, <hi>de Migrat. Abrah. p.</hi> 309. <hi>D. E. F.</hi> And <hi>de Decal. p.</hi> 576. <hi>D. C.</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 593. <hi>F.</hi> he ſpoke by a voice which he created. And <hi>Lib. de Praem. p.</hi> 705. The <hi>Targum</hi> affirms the ſame that <hi>Jehovah</hi> revealed himſelf, with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Angels, when he gave his Law, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 11.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:93550:188"/>
               <p>The ſecond is clear by <hi>Hag.</hi> ii. 6. where the Lord ſpeaking of the time when he brought his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he had ſhaken the Earth;</hi> which relates to his giving the Law, as appears from <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxviii. 8. and <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 25, 26. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> applies that place to our Saviour. And it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged alſo by the <hi>Jews</hi> as the Author of <hi>Rabboth, fol.</hi> 135. <hi>col.</hi> 3. <hi>Onkelos, Deut.</hi> iv. 33, 36. the People heard the voice <hi>of the Word of the Lord out of the fire.</hi> And alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 24. And likewiſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> xx. 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 11. and vi. 13. where the third Commandment is mentioned in theſe words, <hi>None ſhall ſwear by the Name of the Word of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Point is evident according to the conſtant Maxim of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is always accompanied with ſeveral Camps of Angels who attend him and execute his Judgments.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things being noted, I maintain that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that the Law hath been Ordained by Angels, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 2. not to ſay by many Witneſſes, but among or before many Witneſſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. of the Word that hath been ſpoken by Angels, he doth not ſpeak of the Law, but of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral threatnings which were made by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to whom the <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:93550:189"/>
               <p>It muſt be underſtood ſo neceſſarily; or it is impoſſible to ſave St. <hi>Paul</hi> from having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted himſelf in the ſame Epiſtle: For he ſuppoſeth. <hi>ch.</hi> xii. 25, 26. that 'twas Jeſus Chriſt, that being the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhook the Earth, in which he follows the words of <hi>Haggai</hi> the Prophet, and of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxviii. 8. and who can reconcile that with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, that many Angels Ordained the Law? Did they all perſonate God in that occaſion? No body hath ever imagined ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>It cannot be objected to me that St. <hi>Paul</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Perſon of Jeſus to <hi>Moſes</hi> as it hath been done by St. <hi>John, ch.</hi> i. where he ſaith, that the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>Grace and Truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The reaſon is clear, and it is becauſe he oppoſes the Miniſtry of Reconciliation to the Miniſtry of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: <hi>Moſes</hi> hath been the Mediator of the firſt Covenant, but Jeſus Chriſt is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the ſecond, although both Miniſtries were originally from God.</p>
               <p>I need not ſpend much time to confute the fancy of thoſe who ſay that the Angel of the Lord is named <hi>Jehovah,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Ambaſſador. For it is a Notion which the <hi>Unitarians</hi> have borrowed from the Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Menaſſeh Ben Iſr.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 44. But I have fully proved that it is a new Notion forged by them to ſave their new Syſtem. It is ſo certain that the Old <hi>Jews</hi> believed that an Angel could not ſay, I am <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> xx. that even the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> affirm, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpoke theſe words, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:93550:189"/> which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt;</hi> Though they ſay that the reſt of the Law was ſpoken by <hi>Moſes. Shir. Haſhirin Rabba, fol.</hi> 5. <hi>col.</hi> 1.</p>

            <div n="23" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub"> That neither <hi>Philo,</hi> nor the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts, nor the Chriſtians, have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Platonick</hi> Philoſophers, their Notions about the Trinity. But that <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould have more probably borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Notions from the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, which he was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.</head>
               <p>HAving in the foregoing Chapters ſhewn that the Doctrine of the Trinity has its Ground in the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; and that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt, did acknowledge it, as appears from many places in the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Authors in <hi>Philo,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts, who were exactly followed by Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and the Primitive Chriſtians: It may be ſeen how falſly the <hi>Socinians</hi> pretend that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was the Author of the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>But to put them altogether from this Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I will ſhew that nothing can be more abſurd, than to ſay, that if <hi>Philo</hi> was not a Chriſtian, he was at leaſt a <hi>Platoniſt;</hi> and that the Fathers, particularly <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:93550:190"/> brought into the Chriſtian Religion a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they borrowed from <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>Philo</hi>'s being a <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> I ſay firſt, that though this were granted, yet it would do the <hi>Unitarians</hi> no good. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatever Notions the <hi>Greeks</hi> had of Divine matters, they had from <hi>Pherecides,</hi> a <hi>Syrian,</hi> who lived a long time before <hi>Plato,</hi> and was <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Maſter. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (who afterwards was much followed by the <hi>Greeks</hi>) travelled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and into <hi>Chaldea,</hi> after he had had <hi>Pherecides</hi> to his Maſter. <hi>Plotinus</hi> does ingenuouſly confeſs that the three Original Hypoſtaſes were not of <hi>Plato</hi>'s inventions but were known before him; and this he makes out from <hi>Parmenides</hi> his Writings, who had treated of this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Plot. Enn.</hi> 5. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. Now <hi>Parmenides</hi> had the Notion of the Trinity from the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> whoſe Maſter <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had probably borrowed it from the <hi>Jews,</hi> with whom he converſed in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I own that <hi>Philo</hi> was compared by many with <hi>Plato,</hi> as to his Stile, and that lively Eloquence for which <hi>Plato</hi> was ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. One may ſee by his Book, <hi>Quod omnis probus ſit Liber,</hi> and many other of his Works, that he was very converſant in theſe <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, both Poets and Philoſophers. But he had been ſo little acquainted with <hi>Plato</hi>'s Works, that he brings ſome of <hi>Plato</hi>'s opinion upon the credit of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> We ſee that in his Book, <hi>Quod mundus ſit, p.</hi> 728, <hi>&amp;</hi> 729. He never proves his Doctrines by the Authority of <hi>Plato.</hi> He Grounds all he ſays upon the Divine Authority, ſpeaking in the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:93550:190"/> Old Teſtament, well reflected upon as you ſee <hi>p.</hi> 288. where he ſpeaks of the Three who appeared to <hi>Abraham.</hi> A <hi>Jew</hi> as he was, could not well have ſuited his Notions with <hi>Plato</hi>'s. For, <hi>Plato</hi> believed, for inſtance, That Matter was Eternal, and uncreated, which is poſitively contrary to what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays of the Creation of the World; and as poſitively rejected by <hi>Philo,</hi> in his Books of Providence; and that Matter had a Beginning.</p>
               <p>As to the Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaks of it ſo obſcurely, that one may juſtly wonder, how ſome Chriſtians formerly made uſe of his Teſtimony to prove it. Probably he had heard of it in <hi>Egypt.</hi> But what he ſays about it in his <hi>Parmenides,</hi> though quoted by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> ſhews that he had not a very true Notion of it. He ſpeaks of an Eternal and unbegotten Being. He attributes to that Being, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a firſt Underſtanding, and a firſt Life. And <hi>Proclus</hi> does diſtinguiſh thoſe three Principles of <hi>Plato,</hi> as three different Beings. But <hi>Plotinus</hi> does not agree in this with <hi>Proclus,</hi> and affirms that theſe Three are but one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why many Chriſtians have ſo much eſteemed <hi>Plato,</hi> is the nobleneſs of his Morals; the Maxims of which are much more elevated and Chriſtian-like, than thoſe of other Heathen Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Philo</hi> ſeems to have followed <hi>Plato</hi>'s Expreſſions, when he calls the Word of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſecond God. But it muſt be obſerved, Firſt, that <hi>Philo</hi> never owns above one God. And ſecondly, that he uſed
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:93550:191"/> that expreſſion, to mark the diſtinction which is between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already.</p>
               <p>Let the thing be conſidered in its ſelf. It is certain that the Notion of the Trinity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had from Reaſon. It muſt therefore be a Doctrine, either revealed by God, or devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Plato,</hi> or ſome other from whom he received it. But the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> are ſo far from believing their Maſter to be the firſt inventer of it, that <hi>Proclus</hi> affirms it to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>piece of Divinity delivered by God himſelf.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Numenius</hi> a famous <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> who lived under the two <hi>Antonines,</hi> and was therefore <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Contemporary, expreſly maintains that <hi>Plato</hi> during his thirteen years ſtay in <hi>Egypt,</hi> had learnt the Doctrine of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us in his firſt Sermon againſt the <hi>Greeks.</hi> For, it is certain that many <hi>Jews</hi> fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> after <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and after the death of <hi>Gedaliah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Teſtimonies are enough to prove that <hi>Plato</hi> was not the firſt Inventer of the Notion of a Trinity.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>Philo</hi> borrowed not his Notions from <hi>Plato,</hi> may further appear, becauſe <hi>Philo</hi> lived at a time when <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophy had long ago loſt much of its credit. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did much leſſen it. But it was much more creſt-fallen when the opinions of <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> prevailed. <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Philoſophy ſpread it ſelf as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> although the Maxims of it were barbarous and unnatural. And in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s days that of <hi>Epicurus</hi> was much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed at <hi>Athens.</hi> That of the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> got
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:93550:191"/> much Ground likewiſe. So that <hi>Plato</hi> had but a very few Diſciples left him. In <hi>Plato</hi>'s days there ſtarted up at <hi>Alexandria</hi> a Sect of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, the Head of whom was one <hi>Polemo,</hi> who lived under <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> Theſe freely rejected the moſt famous Opinions, and pickt out what they found moſt rational in the ſeveral Sects of Philoſophers, for which reaſon they were called <hi>Electicks</hi> or Chuſers. And one needs but read <hi>Philo</hi> with Judgment, to find that he followed this Sect.</p>
               <p>It appears that <hi>Philo</hi>'s great deſign in all his Works, is to ſhew, That the <hi>Jews</hi> were infinitely above the Heathens, both as to Virtue and Knowledge: In which he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi>'s Notions, who had writ long before him, and was a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Philoſopher. And of this Opinion the <hi>Jews</hi> are to this day, as may be ſeen in <hi>Cozri, p.</hi> 29,—and <hi>p.</hi> 131. And as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> lookt upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> as Children in learning, which they were fain to fetch from <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo <hi>Philo</hi> calls often the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> even of the moſt ancient times, a heavy People, and who wanted common Senſe, by reaſon of the many groſs Errors they entertain'd, unworthy of rational Creatures.</p>
               <p>In a word, I affirm, that if <hi>Plato</hi> had any diſtinct Notions in Religion, he moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had them from the <hi>Jews</hi> while he ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as it is maintained by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Appion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts, I do not ſee how they can be ſuſpected to have had a Tincture of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine: It muſt be a mere Fancy to ſuppoſe it. Let thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men read exactly the Books of <hi>Philo,</hi> and find
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:93550:192"/> therein, if they can, ſuch an Expreſſion as we have in the <hi>Targum</hi> upon <hi>Hag.</hi> ii. 4, 5. <hi>I am with you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, with the Word which covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit which abideth in the midſt of you. M. N.</hi> hath been ſenſible of that; and therefore he does not accuſe them of having been <hi>Platoniſts;</hi> but he accuſes the Orthodox Chriſtians in general to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Books whatever in them is favourable to the Doctrines of the Trinity, and of the Divinity of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Unitarians</hi> muſt have very little Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Jews,</hi> to fancy that they are ſo ſimple as to be thus abuſed. How can it be imagined that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be ſuch Friends to Chriſtians, as to truſt them with their Books in order to falſify them? And afterwards ſo ſottiſh, as to ſpread every where their Books and their <hi>Targums</hi> which they falſified? This Suppoſition is ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that I cannot imagine how any Author can write ſuch a thing, or even conceive and ſuppoſe it.</p>
               <p>What I ſaid of the Goſpel Notions in the 15th Chapter, ſhews plainly that neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles did adopt the Syſtem of Philoſophy which was taught by the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Angel who declared his Conception, uſed the word Lord or <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to denote his being God: But when he named him Jeſus, becauſe he was to ſave his People from their ſins, which no other could do but God, he intimated that it was he who was foretold, not by <hi>Plato,</hi> but by <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> chap. iii. 8,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93550:192"/> 13, 18. <hi>I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> In which place the Prophet expreſly calls God <hi>Saviour</hi> or <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by which Name Chriſt by Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was named.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, a man muſt be out of his Senſes, to find any thing in the Goſpel that ſavours of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Hypotheſis. When the Devils own Chriſt to be the Son of God, were they <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſts?</hi> When St. <hi>Peter</hi> owns him to be the Son of God, had <hi>Plato</hi> told him this? When he was ask'd in the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was the Son of God, was the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made in a <hi>Platonick</hi> ſenſe?</p>
               <p>It is true, St. <hi>Paul</hi> has ſometimes quoted Heatheniſh Authors; he was brought up at <hi>Tarſus</hi> amongſt Heathens; he had read <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> whom he quotes againſt the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophers at <hi>Athens;</hi> and he quotes a place out of the <hi>Cretan Epimenides</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> who was Biſhop of <hi>Crete.</hi> But we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find that he quoted <hi>Plato,</hi> or uſed his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony.</p>
               <p>Chriſt choſe illiterate men for his Apoſtles; St. <hi>John,</hi> who ſpeaks of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, had been a Fiſherman about the Lake of <hi>Tiberias:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> only, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> were Scholars. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was brought up under <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a Doctor of the Law; and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who had been a Phyſician, and was a Learned Man, followed St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Travels, and by his directions writ his Goſpel. But it does not appear that our Saviour taught his ignorant Diſciples the Notions of <hi>Plato;</hi> nor that the Learned ones, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> ever uſed <hi>Plato</hi>'s Authority in their Preaching.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:93550:193"/> This appears plainly in the Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> in which St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives an account of it. If at any time St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a fair opportunity to make uſe of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Teſtimony, it was when he diſputed at <hi>Athens</hi> againſt the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and the <hi>Epicureans.</hi> Theſe laſt laughing at Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrought none there to convince them: But he might have quoted places out of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Republick, to prove the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Judgment in the Life to come; yet he quotes never an Author, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to argue the Caſe by ſtrength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and this he did with that force, that he converted one of the Judges of <hi>Areopagus,</hi> who probably was an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> and knew what <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid in his Books, and did laugh at it.</p>
               <p>This Method of the Apoſtles was followed by the firſt Chriſtians; <hi>Plato</hi> was not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned amongſt them, till ſome Philoſophers turned Chriſtians; <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> amongſt others. This <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſcorned all other Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers as mean-ſpirited Teachers; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Plato,</hi> as being one of a great Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, that made him think of God and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, in a more elevated manner than other Philoſophers. But when all is done, How much did he value <hi>Plato?</hi> But indifferently: He declares that it was from the Goſpel, together with the Law and the Prophets, that he had the true Notions of the Chriſtian Religion. He quotes <hi>Plato</hi> neither againſt the Heathens, nor againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> If we had the Book he writ againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> who out of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Writings had broach'd his deteſtable Opinions, we might
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93550:193"/> very probably have ſeen how little he valued <hi>Plato</hi>'s Authority. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who had read <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Book, and who ſaw that both the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and the <hi>Valentinians</hi> made much of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Authority; ſhews plainly how little he valued <hi>Plato,</hi> when he ſays he was grown <hi>omnium haereticorum condimentarium,</hi> the ſawce which all Hereticks uſed to propagate their Doctrines, by which they corrupted the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Chriſtian Religion. And much the ſame Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> had they that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy; of which it is thought <hi>Origen</hi> was the firſt Broacher.</p>
               <p>However, I aver, Firſt, That the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were no more <hi>Platoniſts</hi> than the <hi>Jews,</hi> that is, did not uſe <hi>Plato</hi>'s Notions in their Syſtem of Divinity. They were ſo far from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it, that they declared that what they believed about the Trinity, they had it from the Holy Writers; <hi>Juſtin Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>Athenagoras p.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Theophilus of Antioch, p.</hi> 100.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is falſe that any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians made any other uſe of <hi>Plato,</hi> than by ſhewing that <hi>Plato</hi> had borrowed from <hi>Moſes</hi> the Doctrine he taught; <hi>Juſtin</hi> in his Exhortation to the <hi>Greeks, p.</hi> 18, 22, 24. <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Strom. l.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 517. and <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 598. <hi>Paedag. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus, l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 198. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 275, 279, 308. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 351, and 371.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The very Heathen Authors own that <hi>Plato</hi> borrowed his Notions from <hi>Moſes;</hi> as <hi>Numenius,</hi> who (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us) did acknowledge that <hi>Plato</hi> had learnt in <hi>Egypt</hi> the Doctrine of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> during his ſtay there for 13 years; <hi>Theod. Serm.</hi> 1.</p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:93550:194"/>
               <p>If any of the Ancient Fathers have quoted any thing out of <hi>Plato</hi> concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they look'd upon it not as <hi>Plato</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but as a Doctrine which he had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Moſes,</hi> or from thoſe who had it from him. Not to ſay, That, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſoever <hi>Plato</hi> propoſed this Doctrine, it is much at one. For his Notions about it are not very exact; and no wonder, ſince it was natural enough for a <hi>Greek</hi> to mix fabulous Notions with what he had from others, and they to adulterate it.</p>
               <p>The truth which we profeſs, and draw from a Divine Original in this matter, is not at all concerned with <hi>Plato</hi>'s Viſions. And yet, ſince the Notion of the Trinity could not poſſibly be framed by any mortal Man, Two conſiderable Uſes may be made of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s Notion about it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſhew, That this Doctrine is not of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, ſince <hi>Plato,</hi> who lived five hundred Years before <hi>Juſtin,</hi> had ſcattered ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it in his Books, which he had proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly learned from the <hi>Jews,</hi> or from ſome other Philoſophers who converſed with the <hi>Jews.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> To make Men ſenſible that the greateſt Scholars among the Heathens did not find ſo many Abſurdities in it, as the now <hi>Socinians</hi> do.</p>
               <p>There is an Objection of greater moment than all the Objections which the <hi>Unitarian</hi> Authors can oppoſe, to my uſing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Judgment of the Old Synagogue, and I will not diſſemble it, although they have not been ſenſible of it. It is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:93550:194"/> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> where he rejects with an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Fables and Genealogies as the fruits of the falſly named Knowledge, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 20, 21. which he compares with a <hi>Cancer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I acknowledg freely that <hi>Ireneus, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 20. and <hi>Tertul. adv. Valentin.</hi> underſtood thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of St. <hi>Paul</hi> againſt the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> of their time, who were come from <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi> And I acknowledge with <hi>Grotius</hi> upon 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 4. that by thoſe infinite Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, which are ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as coming from a vain Philoſophy, and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by ſome of the Heretick <hi>Jews,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had a mind to ſpeak againſt ſeveral Notions of the then new <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cabbala, which was in truth a mixture of the true Tradition of the Synagogue, and of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> who had borrowed their Notions from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And I will not inſiſt now too much upon the judgment of thoſe who think probably enough that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had borrowed their Notions from the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all I maintain that this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt this part of the new <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cabala, which I mention as having ſuch an impure birth, and having been corrupted amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> doth not abate the authority of the proofs of the Trinity, and of the Notions of the Meſſias, which I have brought from all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, and which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing common with thoſe innumerable <hi>aeones</hi> which are mention'd by <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as received by the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and which the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:93550:195"/> Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath condemned in ſome of the Doctors of the Synagogue.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe that there had been in the Body of the Synagogue before Jeſus Chriſt ſome <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and ſome <hi>Baithuſaei</hi> whoſe Birth the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay was as old as that of the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> but who ſeem not ſo ancient, but to have their Origin from one <hi>Simon Boethus</hi> an <hi>Alexandrian Jew</hi> mentioned by <hi>Joſephus.</hi> Let us ſuppoſe that from the time of the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> ſome amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> had adopted ſome <hi>Platonick</hi> or <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Notions, What is that to the Body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, which was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in <hi>Paleſtina</hi> or <hi>Egypt,</hi> but ſpread every where?</p>
               <p>To the contrary, I maintain juſtly that when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condemns the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, he confirms all my Proofs from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, who did not ground their Ideas upon the Doctrine of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> or <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi> but upon the Text of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> When St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath uſed the ſame Notions which are in the Apocryphal Books, in <hi>Philo,</hi> and in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſes, which no body accuſes to have uſed thoſe fooliſh Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies which were found amongſt the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians,</hi> and are to be found now amongſt ſome of the <hi>Cabbaliſts;</hi> he hath ſecured my Argument taken from the pure Traditional Expoſition of the Ancient <hi>Jews;</hi> this is all I have a mind to contend for in this matter, leaving thoſe <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> who have mixed ſome heatheniſh Notions with the Ancient Divinity of the Fathers to ſhift for themſelves, and being not concerned in all their other Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:93550:195"/> although, ſince they have quite forgot this impure Origin they have very much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to uphold them upon ſome Texts of Scripture, but not well underſtood, and taken in another ſenſe.</p>

                  </gap>, ſo frequent amongſt the ancient Interpreters of Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes Maimonides</hi> who lived about the end of the Twelfth Century, affirms that the word <hi>Memra,</hi> which in <hi>Chaldaick</hi> is the ſame as that of <gap reason="foreign">

He ſays alſo, that for the ſame reaſon they often uſed the words <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kara,</hi> Glory; <hi>Shekinah,</hi> Majeſty, or habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But he does manifeſtly wrong them: For if it had been ſo, they would have uſed that caution on other occaſions, whereas they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:93550:196"/> render places of Scripture, where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made only of the Lord, by theſe words, <hi>before the face of the Lord,</hi> which are apt to make people fancy God as being Corporeal. Beſides, if what he ſays were true, they would have uſed the ſame caution where ever the Notion of his being Corporeal might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God. But it is certain that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, as apt to give that Notion of God, they do not uſe the word <hi>Memra</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: And as certain, that in many others, they uſe it where there is no danger of fancying God as having a Body.

               </p>
               <p>Beſides, it is ſo palpable that the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> particularly <hi>Philo,</hi> have given the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as being a Divine Perſon, that <hi>Maimonides</hi> his anſwer can be no other than an Evaſion. Nay it is obſervable that the word <hi>Davar,</hi> which in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies <hi>Word,</hi> is ſometimes explained by that which is a true Perſon, in the Books of the Old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors, who lived ſince Chriſt; even in thoſe whoſe authority <hi>Maimonides</hi> does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge: One of their ancient Books, namely <hi>R. Akiba</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> has theſe words on the Letter <hi>Gimel,</hi> God ſaid, <hi>Thy Word is ſetled for ever in Heaven;</hi> and this Word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing elſe but the healing Angel, as it is written, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> cvii. 20.) <hi>He ſent his Word, and he healed them.</hi> He muſt needs mean a Perſon, namely, an Angel, though perhaps he might miſtake him for a created Angel.</p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:93550:196"/>
               <p>Laſtly, The Notion which <hi>Maimonides</hi> does ſuggeſt can never be applied to <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. 1. which is thus rendred by the Paraphraſt, <hi>The Lord ſaid to his Word:</hi> where the <hi>Word does</hi> manifeſtly denote the Meſſias, as the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> did fairly acknowledge. It is true, that in the common Edition, that place of the <hi>Targum</hi> is rendered thus, <hi>The Lord ſaid in his Word,</hi> or <hi>by his Word;</hi> but it is a poor ſhift: For <hi>in his Word,</hi> does certainly ſignifie <hi>to his Word,</hi> or <hi>of his Word,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> having naturally that double ſignification; as appears from many places.

               <p>You may to this obſervation about <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. 1. add that of the Text of <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxviii. 5. where the Meſſias is named in the room of the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Evaſion uſed by <hi>Moſes Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> is <hi>More Nevoch. pag.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 23. where he tells us in what ſenſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid, that God comes out of his place, namely, that God does manifeſt his Word, which before was hidden from us. For, ſays he, all that is created by God is ſaid to be created by his Word, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth:</hi> By a compariſon taken from Kings, who do what they have a mind to, by their word, as by an Inſtrument. For God needs no Inſtrument to work by, but he works by his bare Will; neither has he any Word properly ſo called. Thus far <hi>Maimonides.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:93550:197"/>
               <p>But it is not true, as I ſhewed before, that <hi>the Word</hi> in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, ſignifies no more than the manifeſtation of the Will of God. I have quoted ſo many places out of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, out of <hi>Philo,</hi> and out of the Paraphraſe it ſelf, which ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that <hi>Maimonides</hi> is not to be believed upon his bare word againſt ſo many formal proofs. It is not true neither, that <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. expreſſes only the bare act of the Will of God, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> does ſuppoſe. I ſhewed before that the great Authors of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Traditions (which <hi>Maimonides</hi> was to follow when he writ his <hi>More Nevochim</hi>) give another ſenſe to thoſe words, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they do eſtabliſh the Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and of the Holy Ghoſt; which they do expreſs by the ſecond and third <hi>Sephira,</hi> or Emanation, in the Divine Eſſence.</p>
               <p>That which made <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſtumble, was that he believed that Chriſtians made the <hi>Word</hi> to be an Inſtrument different from God, which is very far from their opinion. For they do, as well as <hi>Philo,</hi> apprehend the <hi>Word</hi> as a Perſon diſtinct from the Father, but not of a different nature from his; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame Will and Operation common to him and the Father, and this they have by Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>A famous <hi>Socinian</hi> whom I mentioned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, being hard put to it, by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Targums,</hi> has endeavoured in a Tract which he writ (and which has this Title, <hi>Diſceptatio de Verbo, vel Sermone Dei, cujus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrima fit mentio apud Paraphraſt as Chaldaeos,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:93550:197"/> Jonathan, Onkelos, &amp; Targum Hieroſolymita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>) to ſhake it off, by boldly affirming that <hi>the Word of the Lord,</hi> is barely uſed by them to expreſs the following things: The Decree of God: His Commands: His inward Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration: His Promiſe: His Covenant and his Oath to the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> His deſign to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or to do good: A Prophetick Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Providence which protected good Men. In ſhort, <hi>the Word</hi> by which God does promiſe or threaten, and declare what he is reſolved to do: Of which the ſaid Author pretendeth to give many inſtances.</p>
               <p>I have already proved how falſe this is what that Author ſo poſitively affirms, that the term <hi>Word</hi> is never found to be uſed by the Paraphraſts, to denote a Perſon. The very place which I juſt now quoted out of <hi>R. Akiba</hi>'s Alphabet, were enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him. I need not repeat neither what I ſaid, that ſuppoſing all were true which he affirms of the uſe of the word <hi>Memra</hi> in the Paraphraſts, yet he could not but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <hi>Philo</hi> gives quite another Notion of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, namely, as of a real Perſon; in which he viſibly follows the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> The <hi>Unitarians</hi> of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do for that reaſon reject <hi>Philo</hi>'s Works as being Suppoſititious, and written after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's time.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore that the ſenſe which he puts upon the <hi>Targums,</hi> is very far from the true meaning of the words which they uſe when they ſpeak of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I ſhall not examine whether in any place of the <hi>Targums</hi> the word <hi>Memra</hi> is uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93550:198"/> of that of <hi>Davar,</hi> which in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Word or Command of God. <hi>Rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangel</hi> poſitively denies it: And the truth is that the <hi>Targums</hi> commonly render the word <hi>Davar</hi> by <hi>Pitgama,</hi> and not by <hi>Memra.</hi> To be fully ſatisfied of it, one needs but take an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Concordance upon the word <hi>Davar,</hi> and ſearch whether the Paraphraſts ever ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it by <hi>Memra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing <hi>Rittangel</hi> ſhould deny the thing too poſitively, however the <hi>Targumiſts</hi> do ſo exactly diſtinguiſh <hi>the Word</hi> when they mention him as a Divine Perſon, that it is impoſſible to miſtake him in all places, by putting upon them thoſe ſenſes which the <hi>Socinian</hi> Author endeavours to affix to them, that he may deſtroy the Notion which they give of <hi>the Word,</hi> as being a Divine Perſon. And though I have already alledged many proofs of it, yet this being a matter of great moment I will again briefly ſpeak to it, to confute that Author, and thoſe who ſhall borrow his Arguments.</p>
               <p>Let an impartial Reader judge whether any of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Author's ſenſes can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the word <hi>Memra,</hi> in <hi>Onkelos</hi> his <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, Gen.</hi> iii. 8. They heard the voice of the Word of the Lord. And <hi>Gen.</hi> xv. 1, 5, 9. where the <hi>Word</hi> appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> brought him forth, and commanded him to offer a Sacrifice to him.</p>
               <p>And ſuppoſe that the word <hi>Memra</hi> ſhould in ſome places have ſome of the ſenſes which the <hi>Socinian</hi> Author mentions, does it follow that it has not in many other places the ſenſe we give to it, and which <hi>Philo</hi> gave
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93550:198"/> to it before Chriſt? Let it be granted it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſometimes the Command of God, as <hi>Gen.</hi> xxii. 18. can it have the ſame ſenſe in a number of places where mention is made of the Laws of the Word of the Lord? Let the word <hi>Memra</hi> be taken ſometimes in the <hi>Targums</hi> for the Decree of God, can it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that ſenſe in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Hag.</hi> ii. 6. where it is diſtinguiſht from that Decree? or in thoſe lately Printed in the Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> where mention is made of the Decree of <hi>the Word</hi> of the Lord, as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xii. 23. Were it not a ridiculous Tautology, if in that place <hi>the Word</hi> ſhould be ſaid to ſignifie the Decree? The ſame may be ſaid of all other places where the Decree of the Word is ſpoken of, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> vi. 4, 15. xxix. 23. xxxiii. 3.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing that <hi>Memra</hi> ſignifies ſometimes the Word of God, can it ſignifie ſo too, where we read, <hi>according to the word of the Memra,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 23. Let it be granted that <hi>the Word</hi> ſignifies ſometimes the Oracles of God, can it ſignifie them alſo, where it is expreſly diſtinguiſht from them, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xx. 20. <hi>ch.</hi> xxxvi. 12. And from the Law of God in the ſame place? The truth is, the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt does ſuppoſe that it was the <hi>Memra</hi> who gave the Law and the Oracles to the <hi>Jews:</hi> And that it was for refuſing to offer Sacrifices to him, that the <hi>Jews</hi> often fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolatry, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xiii. 11. <hi>ch.</hi> xxviii. 19. xxix. 19. xxx. 5.</p>
               <p>There are ſo many proofs, that the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts mention it in many places in the very ſame ſenſe the Old <hi>Jews</hi> gave to it, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:93550:199"/> the <hi>Word</hi> of God to be a Perſon, that no Man can miſtake, unleſs he does it wilfully. Many of their Works have been Printed almoſt two hundred years, and I have produced ſo many proofs out of them, that I need not alledge any more.

               <p>In a word the Author of this <hi>Targum</hi> leaves no room to doubt, but that by the <hi>Word</hi> he underſtood and meant in many places a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon, a Principle of Action, ſuch as we conceive him to be. Though in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he might uſe the word <hi>Word</hi> in thoſe other different Significations, which the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Author who writ againſt <hi>Wecknerus,</hi> was pleaſed to put upon it.</p>
               <p>Another Objection of the ſame <hi>Socinian</hi> Author, which ſeems more plauſible is this, That there are ſome places in the <hi>Targum,</hi> where inſtead of the Holy Spirit, as it is in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> they render it by <hi>Memra,</hi> or <hi>the Word;</hi> of which he gives ſome inſtances, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxx. 28. <hi>Zech.</hi> iv. 6. To which may be added, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlviii. 16. which in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>the Lord and his Spirit has ſent me;</hi> and in the Paraphraſe, <hi>the Lord and his Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that though in ſome few places the <hi>Targums</hi> have a confuſed Notion of the thing, yet this ought not to ballance the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtile of thoſe Books, in others, and much more numerous places: It being eaſie to confound thoſe Notions before the Goſpel-times, when they were not, by much, ſo clearly apprehended, as they have been ſince. Otherwiſe, the ſtile of the <hi>Targums</hi> is pretty equal: And here comes in very naturally <hi>Maimonides</hi> his obſervation about the ſtile of <hi>Onkelos</hi> his Paraphraſe, which he was well verſed in. He thinks in his <hi>More Nevochim, p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 48. that three or four places of the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:93550:200"/> 
                  <hi>Targum,</hi> in which his remark about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant method had no room, might have been altered; and wiſhes he could get ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of it, more ancient than thoſe he uſed; and owns that he did not well apprehend the reaſon which had obliged the Paraphraſt to render, in ſome places otherwiſe than he uſually rendered, which yet he did for great reaſons.</p>
               <p>One great Objection of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which he much inſiſts upon, is that the Chriſtians never quoted the Authority of the <hi>Targum</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> before <hi>Galatinus,</hi> who lived at the beginning of the 16th. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. But that ſince him, <hi>Heinſius, Vechnerus,</hi> and ſome others, followed him in that fancy.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing this to be true, I cannot ſee what advantage it would be to him. Put caſe the Ancients were not capable Scholars enough to peruſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Books, can this ever prejudice truth? And ought not they to be received, how late ſoever they come, by whoſe care ſoever they be vindicated and aſſerted?</p>
               <p>But it is abſolutely falſe that Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Galatinus,</hi> have nothing of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Opinions about this matter. I ſhewed in the vii. <hi>Chap.</hi> of this Book, that <hi>Ribera</hi> and others, which would have theſe Paraphraſes to be written after St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> are much miſtaken: And conſequently this <hi>Socinian</hi> Author who followed them, and <hi>Vorſtius</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Tſemach David,</hi> was alſo miſtaken about the Antiquity of the <hi>Targums.</hi> But our <hi>Socinian</hi> ſays, if they are ſo ancient, how comes it to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:93550:201"/> paſs that they have not been quoted by the Chriſtians that diſputed againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter Times? They were very few of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians that writ upon theſe matters. And of them yet fewer underſtood the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> or even the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue; moſt of them reſted upon the Authority of <hi>Philo,</hi> of the Book of Wiſdom, and of other Authors, who were famous among the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt, and who had writ full enough upon this Subject, as may be ſeen by what <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> quotes out of them. And no doubt thoſe places of <hi>Philo,</hi> and thoſe other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, were well known to <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and to <hi>Origen,</hi> whoſe Work <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> much followed, as appears by reading his Books, and as he himſelf does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinian</hi> Author affirms too poſitively, that <hi>Galatinus</hi> is the firſt that uſed that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Targums.</hi> He muſt not ſuppoſe a thing which is abſolutely falſe. <hi>Origin, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>in Celſum,</hi> ſpeaks of a Diſpute between <hi>Jaſon</hi> and <hi>Papiſcus,</hi> in which ſaith <hi>Origin, Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ex Judaicis Scriptoribus cum Judaeo deſcribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur diſputans, &amp; plane demonſtrans quae de Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto extant &amp; vaticinia Jeſu ipſi congruere,</hi> &amp;c. What were thoſe Writings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the <hi>Targums,</hi> who had tranſlated <hi>Becocma</hi> for <hi>Breſchith,</hi> according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Notion which I have explained ſo many times; and for which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> reflects upon <hi>Jaſon,</hi> who hath quoted the <hi>Targums,</hi> as if he hath read them in <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, it appears by <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Martyr's Dialogue with <hi>Trypho,</hi> That in his time ſome
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:93550:201"/> 
                  <hi>Jews</hi> had already endeavoured to invalidate the Proofs taken out of Scripture in their ſo frequent Stile, about the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as we ſee them in the <hi>Targums.</hi> For <hi>Juſtin</hi> undertakes to prove, that the <hi>Word</hi> is not barely an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in God, nor an Angel, but a Perſon, and a true Principle of Action. And this he proves by his Apparitions, and by other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and Signs of a real Perſon, ſuch as are his executing his Father's Counſels, his being his Off-ſpring, and his Son, properly ſo called. Here I muſt add one thing, which is, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> hath expreſs'd the Senſe of the <hi>Targum</hi> in many places, eſpecially upon the Prophets, which Senſe he had no doubt from the learned <hi>Jews</hi> whom he had conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and they from the <hi>Targums.</hi> I confeſs, that <hi>Jerome</hi> never made his buſineſs to write againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor did any other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that was ever able to make uſe of the <hi>Targums.</hi> Some, indeed, of the Fathers took the pains to learn <hi>Hebrew,</hi> becauſe the Old Teſtament was writ in that Language; but thoſe were very few, and none of them ever troubled himſelf with the <hi>Chaldee.</hi> St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> himſelf, how skilful ſoever in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> underſtood not the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> as appears by his Writings. The firſt that ſet himſelf to beat the <hi>Jews</hi> with their own Weapons, was <hi>Raimundus Martini,</hi> a convert <hi>Jew,</hi> who lived about the Year of Chriſt, 1260. He writ a Book againſt them, call'd <hi>Pugio Fidei,</hi> which ſhews he had well ſtudied their <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> and he makes uſe of their <hi>Targums</hi> to very good purpoſe. Out of this Book, there was another compos'd, and call'd <hi>Victoria ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:93550:202"/> Judaeos,</hi> by <hi>Porchetus Salvaticus,</hi> that is ſaid to have lived in the next Century. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Books was much conſidered in thoſe ignorant times wherein they lived. So that when Learning came more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, one might venture to make uſe of their labours, and ſet them forth as his own, with little danger of being diſcover'd. This very thing was done by <hi>Galatinus,</hi> who lived about the end of the Fifteenth Century. He did with great Impudence almoſt tranſcribe his Notions, and the Arguments againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> out of that Work of <hi>Porchetus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as mentioning his Name. That <hi>Socinian</hi> mentions the <hi>Pugio</hi> in the cloſe of that Book againſt <hi>Vechner,</hi> by which it may be ſuppoſed he read that Book of <hi>Raimundus</hi> above mentioned. Which if he did, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd it with <hi>Galatinus,</hi> he could not but ſee that this Work of <hi>Galatinus</hi> was, as to the main of it, a Stream from that Fountain of <hi>Raimund</hi>'s <hi>Pugio.</hi> And if he ſaw it, he did very diſingenuouſly in making <hi>Galatinus</hi> the firſt among Chriſtians that made uſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Notions.</p>
               <p>The laſt Objection of the <hi>Unitarians</hi> (againſt what I have proved about the <hi>Word's</hi> being a Perſon, from the conſent of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſes, when they ſpeak of the <hi>Memra</hi> of the Lord, and his Actions) is made by the ſame <hi>Socinian</hi> Author, who affirms, that in the <hi>Targums</hi> the <hi>Memra</hi> implies no more than that God works by himſelf, becauſe the word <hi>Memra</hi> is uſed of Men, as well as of God.</p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:93550:202"/>
               <p>I will not deny but that here and there in the <hi>Targums,</hi> the word <hi>Memra</hi> has that Senſe, as <hi>Hacſpan</hi> well obſerves in his Notes on <hi>Pſalm</hi> cx. and produces many Inſtances of it, to which many more might be added.</p>
               <p>But when all is done, this Objection, much the ſame with that of <hi>Moſes Maimonides,</hi> can't abſolutely take away that force of thoſe Texts where the <hi>Memra</hi> is uſed of God; and to be ſatisfied of this, it is but making the following Reflexions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Philo,</hi> one of the moſt famous <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> very well apprehended, and clearly declared, That by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which anſwers to the Hebrew <hi>Memra,</hi> the old <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood a real Principle of Action, ſuch as we call a Perſon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors more ancient than <hi>Philo,</hi> had the very ſame Notion of it, as may be ſeen in the Book of <hi>Baruch,</hi> and in that of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Notions of which <hi>Philo</hi> has clearly followed in his Book, <hi>de Agric. apud Euſeb. de Proepar. Evang. pag.</hi> 323. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That even ſince Chriſt, the <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi> Authors fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and to this day do follow the ſame Notion; making uſe of thoſe places where the <hi>Memra</hi> and the <hi>Cochma,</hi> that is to ſay, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are mentioned; to make out their ſecond <hi>Sephira,</hi> as I ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Neither muſt it ſeem ſtrange, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paraphraſe ſhould uſe that word in various Senſes: For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> had many Senſes in <hi>Greek,</hi> and ſo might that of <hi>Memra</hi> have in <hi>Chaldee,</hi> without prejudicing our Arguments. For the places which I have
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:93550:203"/> quoted are of that nature, that there can be no Equivocation in them, as any Man will own, that is not reſolved to diſpute againſt truth.</p>

               <head type="sub"> An Anſwer to an Objection againſt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Old <hi>Jews</hi> compared with thoſe of the new Ones:</head>
               <p>A Greater Objection than all theſe, may be very naturally made by a Judicious Reader, concerning what I ſaid of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt, about the diſtinction of Divine Perſons, and the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. On the one ſide, may he ſay, you own that the <hi>Jews</hi> after Chriſt, have oppoſed the Doctrine of the Trinity, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the Unity of God; there are plain proofs of it, even in the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. And it is certain that <hi>Trypho</hi> did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Meſſias was to be any other than a meer Man, and ſo did the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as it is witneſſed by <hi>Orig. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contr. Celſ. pag.</hi> 79. And on the other ſide you affirm that the <hi>Jews</hi> in the old times before Chriſt taught a Doctrine much like that of the Trinity; and that all their ancient Authors affirmed that the Meſſias was to have the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this difficulty, I cannot ſay that the <hi>Jews</hi> have altered their opinion upon this Subject, ſince the beginning of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:93550:203"/> for to this day their Cabaliſtical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, whom they reſpect as great Divines, do profeſs the ſame which <hi>Philo</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts did. I cannot ſay nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they are divided into two Sects, the one of which follows theſe Notions, the other oppoſes them: For though the Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts are fewer in number than thoſe who ſtick to the letter of the Law, and ſtudy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand the Ceremonies of it, to which they add the Traditions contained in the <hi>Miſna,</hi> and the <hi>Guemarra,</hi> yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is no great controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them about thoſe Doctrines which I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>I anſwer therefore, firſt by owning that whatever Notions the old <hi>Jews</hi> had of theſe matters, they were neither ſo clear or diſtinct but that they were mixt with divers Errors, of which there are many inſtances both in <hi>Philo</hi> and the <hi>Targums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I maintain withal, that how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſoever ſome of thoſe Notions are in thoſe ancient Authors, yet it is certain that thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that turn Chriſtians do it by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Principles I have mentioned, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by following what is in them conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Scripture, and rejecting what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. And I dare affirm that all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jews</hi> who ſincerely turn Chriſtians, do it by reflecting upon thoſe old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Principles, which they originally find in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afterwards to be agreeable with the Principles of Chriſtianity. This plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Dialogue between <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Trypho</hi> a <hi>Jew.</hi> For <hi>Juſtin</hi> having
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:93550:204"/> quoted thoſe places out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which God calls the Meſſias, his Son, the Almighty God, and one that is to be adored. <hi>Trypho</hi> anſwers in theſe words, <hi>I allow that thoſe ſo many and ſo great proofs are enough to perſwade, Pag.</hi> 302. <hi>B.</hi> All the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty he makes, is about the Application which Chriſtians and <hi>Juſtin</hi> in particular, made to Chriſt, of thoſe places of Scripture. For it appears that <hi>Trypho</hi> applying <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> ix. to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>Hillel,</hi> who afterwards affirmed that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was the promiſed Meſſias, and that no other was to be expected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay farther, that the <hi>Jews</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with the opinion of the Meſſias's coming to have a Temporal Kingdom, and offended by the mean Circumſtances of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, did reject Chriſt's Revelation, and were thereby hindered from ſeeing, how conformable it was with their old Notions. This will not ſeem ſtrange to one that conſiders the force of their prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and what was done by their Anceſtors in a like caſe. For theſe killed the Prophets, no doubt finding much contradiction at firſt, as they imagin'd, between the old Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and the new ones, for which cauſe they rejected the new Prophets, and put the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them to death: Though afterwards they were forced to receive thoſe very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, the Authors of which they had put to death, as going upon the ſame Grounds with the old Prophecies, the Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of which they acknowledged.</p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:93550:204"/>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſay, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who lived immediately after Chriſt, endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his being put to death, as a juſt and legal Act; for tho' the <hi>Synagogue had Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated him,</hi> yet he had continued to teach to draw his Diſciples from obſerving the Law; ſo that they pretended that he was a falſe Prophet; that he wrought his Miracles by the power of the Devil; and that he had been juſtly puniſht, according to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. 5. and xviii. 20. To this end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they ſent to their Synagogues all the World over, Men of great Authority, to make them receive and ſubſcribe the <hi>Anathema</hi> which they had drawn up againſt Chriſt and his Diſciples; as <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> tells us in his <hi>Dialogue with Trypho, pag.</hi> 234. <hi>E.</hi> To which <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> it ſeems St. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 6. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 22. as may be ſeen in the very place of <hi>Juſtin</hi> now quoted, and in <hi>pag.</hi> 266. <hi>E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fifth place, I ſay, that ſoon after the Preaching of the Goſpel they begun to defame our Saviour horribly, about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Birth, as may be ſeen in a Book called <hi>Toledoth Jeſu,</hi> which was known long before <hi>Origen:</hi> And about his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as may be ſeen in the <hi>Talmud.</hi> They likewiſe defamed the Apoſtles, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, who laboured to draw off the People from obſerving the Law. And though ſuch Calumnies were very groſs, and viſibly falſe, yet they found credit with their people to make them cry down Chriſtianity; as it is uſual in ſuch caſes. Thus when <hi>Papiſts</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:93550:205"/> to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that they believe thus and thus, though their Accuſations are viſibly falſe, and themſelves are forced to acknowledge it, yet at the ſame time they prevail with their People, and turn them quite from the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay in the ſixth place, that afterwards they yet more horribly traduced our Saviour, accuſing him to have trained up his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to Idolatry, and to have himſelf been guilty of it. This they took occaſion to do, from the ſuperſtitious reſpects ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had for the Croſs; which made them give out, that Jeſus Chriſt having been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by his Maſter, and refuſed the Abſolution which he begged of him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he had withdrawn himſelf from him, and brought up his Diſciples after his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to worſhip <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Brick, by which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the figure of a Croſs. <hi>Sanhedrin, fol.</hi> 107. <hi>&amp; Sota, fol.</hi> 47.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It may be obſerved, that the many Hereſies which aroſe in after-times among Chriſtians concerning our Saviour's Perſon and Natures, gave the <hi>Jews</hi> very great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the Goſpel. The <hi>Arians</hi> for two hundred years; then the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and <hi>Eutychians,</hi> but chiefly the <hi>Tritheiſts,</hi> viſibly taught Doctrines contrary to truth. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular the Writings of <hi>John Philoponus,</hi> who was a <hi>Tritheiſt</hi> were much peruſed by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe they begun to ſtudy Philoſophy, (at which <hi>John Philoponus</hi> was very good) as <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us, <hi>More Nevochim, pag.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 71. Now this Hereſie deſtroying the Unity of God, which is the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:93550:205"/> fundamental Article of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, could not but give the <hi>Jews</hi> juſt matter of horror and deteſtation for Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves confeſs that in their diſperſion they have loſt the knowledge of many of the Myſteries of their Religion. One cannot think how it could be otherwiſe, if one conſiders, 1. The long time they have been diſperſed, which confounds the moſt diſtinct, and darkens the cleareſt matters. 2. Their extreme miſery in ſo long a capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which ſubjected them to ſo many differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nations, and many of them ſuch as had a particular hatred both of their Nation and Religion. 3. But chiefly if one conſiders that thoſe Myſteries were communicated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a few Learned Men, and kept from the knowledge of the common people; as <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> does acknowledg, and proves by many Reflections worth conſidering, in <hi>More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voch. p.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 71.</p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>Jews</hi> having ſtill great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Chriſtians, it ought not to ſeem ſtrange that the Cabaliſts ſhould be ſo few in number among them; and that moſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors ſhould follow in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes againſt Chriſtians, Explications and Notions contrary to Scripture, about the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the Divinity of the Meſſias. For, even before Chriſt there were amongſt them many Errors crept amongſt ſome of them, about thoſe matters; ſo that they that lived after Chriſt did eaſily follow the worſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and prefer it before the better, in the heats of their Diſputes againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:93550:206"/>
               <p>Neither is it to be wondered at, that the ſame Men ſhould maintain contrary Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and defend them equally in their turns, as they come ta have to do with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent adverſaries. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance of this; when they diſpute and write againſt the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> to prove the Truth of Chriſt's Human Nature, one would admire at the ſtrength and ſoundneſs of their Arguments: But when they are upon the manner of our Saviour's exiſtence in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as to his Fleſh and Blood, nothing can be more contrary to their former Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than what they affirm on this occaſion; they deſtroy quite what they ſaid before, and one would think they had forgot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> do perfectly like the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in this; and having leſs knowledg, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under greater prejudices than they, no wonder if they maintain contrary Principles one to another. This may be ſeen in ſome of the old Hereticks, which ſprung from amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and brought their Opinions into the Chriſtian Religion; the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> for inſtance, who owned that the <hi>Word</hi> had dwelt in Chriſt, but did imagin that it was but for a certain time. And if the <hi>Patripaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Sabellians</hi> who had the clear Revelation of the Goſpel, yet for all this, oppoſed the Doctrine of the Trinity, as contrary to the Unity of God, and affirmed that there was in God but one Perſon which had appeared under three differing Names; It ought not to appear ſtrange that the <hi>Jews</hi> blinded by their hatred againſt Chriſtians,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:93550:206"/> ſhould through their prejudices, apprehend that what their old Maſters taught about the three <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> did not ſignifie three Perſons in God, but only the three different manners in which God works by one and the ſame Perſon.</p>
               <p>I have already hinted, that the <hi>Jews</hi> even about the end of the fourth Century had great offence given them by the Chriſtians in their Worſhip of Saints and Relicks; which being at laſt as Idolatrous as the Heatheniſh, made the <hi>Jews</hi> look upon them as no other than Heathens. This may be ſeen in many places of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which they pretend was finiſht about five hundred years after Chriſt. But eſpecially in their Additions to thoſe Books which they made when Idolatry was ſo ripe both in the Eaſt and the Weſt.</p>
               <p>One might make a Book of thoſe too juſt Accuſations of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which cauſed them to be Baniſht out of many Kingdoms. The <hi>Dominican</hi> Friers made a Collection of moſt of them in the Thirteenth Century, when Chriſtians going much into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> did ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve their loſt knowledg of the <hi>Greek</hi> and other Eaſtern Languages. Since that time the <hi>Jews</hi> tranſcribing their <hi>Talmud,</hi> and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient Books, begun to uſe the words of <hi>Samaritans,</hi> inſtead of thoſe of Apoſtates and Hereticks, which they uſed before in ſpeaking of Chriſtians, againſt whom in the old Times they had made many Rules.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the violent and Antichriſtian me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which ſome Chriſtian Princes uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by a falſe Principle of Religion
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:93550:207"/> to make them, againſt their Will, profeſs Chriſtianity, made them look upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as no better than ſavage Beaſts, which beſides their outward Form had nothing of Humanity, and regarded neither Juſtice nor Religion: For, though their own <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are perſecuting enough, yet they can't but condemn the ſame Principles when uſed againſt them; nothing being more apt to make Men reject Truth, than Perſecution, becauſe Conſcience ought to be inſtructed not inſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as Experience in all Ages does abundantly confirm.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but that the <hi>Jews</hi> Crucified Chriſt for affirming himſelf to be the Son of God. Neither can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he meant no more by it, but that he was God's adoptive Son, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, or ſome of their Kings: For, he ſpoke in an ordinary plain intelligible ſenſe. He meant therefore by it, not only that he was the Meſſias, but that the <hi>Word</hi> of God dwelt in him, the ſame which the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged to be the Off-ſpring of God. And for this the <hi>Jews</hi> Crucifyed him, as he hints plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Parable of the Husbandmen, for he deſigns the Prophets by the name of meer Servants, and himſelf he calls the Son, in oppoſition to the Prophets; and tells the Scribes and Phariſees, that though they knew him to be ſuch, yet would they for all this put him to death. So that by Crucifying him they did purpoſe to deſtroy a Perſon whom they knew to be the true Meſſias, but by whom they were like to have loſt their credit with the People; He having called
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:93550:207"/> them a parcel of Hypocrites, who made a Trade of Religion, who in their hearts laught at it, and only endeavoured to get by it. This is the meaning of thoſe words which Chriſt puts in their mouths, and which was near really in their hearts, <hi>Come let us kill him, and let us ſeiſe on his inheritance.</hi> And not only out of hatred, but out of policy alſo, they oppoſed him, that they might keep themſelves ſafe and quiet. They lookt for a Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meſſias, who ſhould ſubdue all Nations, and bring all their Enemies under them. But here they ſaw Chriſt, a Man deſtitute of all human ſuccours neceſſary to bring about ſo great a deſign: They thought it therefore more adviſable to ſet him aſide without fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Doctrine, than to eſpouſe a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel which might incenſe the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt them, and cauſe the ruin of their Nation: This they meant by ſaying, <hi>The Romans ſhall come and take away both our place and Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be ſatisfied of this, one ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Speculative Doctrines are not the common Rules of publick Deliberations and Counſels. Let the <hi>Papiſts</hi> be an inſtance of it. They proceed in their deciſions upon the Principle of the Pope's Infallibility; when at the ſame time hardly any one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it, and many do confute it both by reaſons and matters of fact not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> likewiſe, though they knew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be fallible enough, yet <hi>Papiſts</hi> like they acted in their publick Aſſembly, as if they had been infallible. And this was enough
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:93550:208"/> to ſatisfie thoſe who could not diſtinguiſh, or would not further inquire into the buſineſs, which was the caſe of moſt ordinary people. Accordingly, of the two Thieves that were Crucifyed with Chriſt, one had obſerved the Injuſtice of that violent hatred the <hi>Jews</hi> had for him: But the other curs'd him looking on him as a falſe Prophet, juſtly condemned by the greateſt Authority known to him in the World.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is certain, that when a deciſion is once made, the People for the moſt part, do not much inquire into the juſtice or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of it, but quietly acquieſce in it, and relye upon the Authority of thoſe who made it. The <hi>Jews</hi> had a particular reaſon to do ſo, being aſſured that their Religion came from God, and not ſeeing any danger in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing it, as it was delivered to them by their Forefathers. And this is now the only reaſon they have for profeſſing <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be wondered at, that the Notions the old <hi>Jews</hi> had of it ſhould make but little impreſſion on their minds, no more than the Doctrines of their Doctors, which they call <hi>Cabaliſts,</hi> becauſe they follow the Traditions of the old Synagogue.</p>
               <p>For their late Teachers, moved by a ſpirit of contradiction, have raiſed many new Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about the Characters of the Meſſias, and other like Articles of Religion, contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between them and the Chriſtians, by which they have plunged their People into inextricable difficulties; and they are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated now againſt us, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be calm enough to take notice of thoſe
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:93550:208"/> viſible Contradictions which may be ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their ancient Writers, and their now Doctors writing upon the ſame ſubject. They deny now adays what the old <hi>Jews</hi> freely granted, and their whole ſtudy is to keep their People in a blind ſubmiſſion to their Authority: Inſomuch that they have this Maxim amongſt them, that the People are obliged to believe that the right Hand is the left, when their Rabbies have once ſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But I ſhall make ſome more particular Reflections upon the proceedings of the now <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſhew that their obſtinacy is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unreaſonable, and that there is no fairneſs at all in their way of diſputing againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>

               <p>But this is not the only place where the <hi>Jews</hi> have changed the faith of their ancient Maſters. There are many others examples of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:93550:209"/> it, ſome of the chief of which I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, after I have obſerved the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees by which they arrived to ſo wide a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement with their Anceſtors.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Doctors, as I have already noted, did early introduce new Notions of ſeveral Texts of the Old Teſtament. I ſpeak not now of their Fabulous fancies only, ſuch as that of <hi>Philo,</hi> who <hi>Lib. de Septenar.</hi> ſuppoſes the Voice of God uttered on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> to have been heard in all parts of the World; to which the <hi>Jews, Pirke Eliez. c.</hi> 41. <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuma, fol.</hi> 73. <hi>col.</hi> 1. have added many more new conceits; but I ſpeak of ſuch their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, as were contrary to, and in effect did overthrow the ancient Notions of the Prophets. As for inſtance, where <hi>Philo</hi> ſeems in ſome manner to maintain the Tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Somn. pag. <hi>455.</hi>
                  </note> of Souls, where he delivers the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Souls Preexiſtence before the Body<note n="†" place="margin">De Mund. p. <hi>891.</hi>

               <p n="2">2ly. It is obſervable that after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s time, ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> who expected the Meſſias, according to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy of the <hi>Seventy Weeks,</hi> but were out in their Accounts of thoſe Weeks, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt intirely loſt the hopes of his coming: This we gather from the Hiſtory of <hi>R. Hillel in Gemara, tit. Sanhed. fol.</hi> 98. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; fol.</hi> 99. <hi>col.</hi> 1. who maintained that the Promiſe of the Meſſias was accompliſhed in the Perſon of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and that there was no more Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah to be expected by the <hi>Jews.</hi> Now they
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:93550:210"/> ſay that this <hi>Hillel</hi> was the Grandſon to <hi>R. Juda</hi> the Compiler of the <hi>Miſna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſee how careleſs they have been in preſerving the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books formerly in eſteem with them, and which indeed but for the Chriſtians, had totally periſhed. <hi>Philo</hi> has borrowed ſome of his Notions in his 2d. Book of <hi>Agriculture;</hi> and let any one compare <hi>Job</hi> xxviii. 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiii. 6. <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 12, 22. with what is written <hi>Wiſdom</hi> vi. 24, 22. and ſo on till <hi>Chap.</hi> viii. 11. and he will find a great likeneſs, if not the very ſame Notions and words.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Through the ſame neglect they have quite loſt the Works of other ancient and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Jews,</hi> as namely of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> who was in ſuch reputation amongſt them, as to be choſen the Agent or Deputy of the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian Jews</hi> in their Embaſſy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour; and of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> who lived in the time of the <hi>Ptolomees,</hi> and Dedicated to one of them his Explication of the Law, of which we have a fragment in <hi>Euſebius;</hi> which ſhews that his Notions were the ſame with <hi>Philo</hi>'s, and that they did generally prevail in <hi>Egypt,</hi> before Chriſt's Incarnation, as well in the time of <hi>Philo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no hard matter to give ſome reaſons of this neglect. For, 1. their firſt deſtruction by <hi>Titus,</hi> and after by <hi>Hadrian,</hi> involved with it a great part of their Books. They thought then only of ſaving their Bibles, with which (it ſeems) their <hi>Targum</hi> was joined, and ſo this came to be preſerved with the Scriptures. This was by the great care of <hi>Joſephus</hi> (as he himſelf relates) deſiring of <hi>Titus</hi> this favour
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:93550:210"/> alone, that he might preſerve the Sacred Books.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After their ſecond deſtruction by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> they applied themſelves ſtraight to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Traditions and Cuſtoms, which now make the Body of their <hi>Miſna,</hi> or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Law, as they call it. This ſpent them a deal of time: For to compoſe ſuch a work, it was neceſſary to collect the ſeveral pieces in the hands of ſeveral men, who had drawn certain Memoirs for the obſervation of every Law that did more immediately concern them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They then began to increaſe their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for the ſtudy of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning themſelves wholly to the ſtudy of their Traditions. This we ſee in the <hi>Miſna Maſ. ſota c.</hi> 9. § 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. About this time, being preſſed with Arguments out of theſe Books by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that diſputed againſt them, they thought beſt to reject the Works themſelves: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Chriſtians uſed the LXX Verſion againſt them, they invented ſeveral Lyes to diſcredit it, as we ſee in the <hi>Gemara</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilla;</hi> and leſt that ſhould not do, they made it their buſineſs to find out ſome that were able to make a new Verſion; ſuch as <hi>Aquila</hi> in the time of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> and <hi>Theodotion,</hi> who turn'd <hi>Jews</hi> toward the end of the Second Century. Theſe Three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters were deſigned to change the Senſe of thoſe Texts which the Chriſtians (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Traditions) did refer to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Of this <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> has given ſome Inſtances in his Dialogue with
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:93550:211"/> 
                  <hi>Trypho, R. Akiba</hi>'s great Friend; and we ſee that St. <hi>Jerom, Ep.</hi> 89. complains of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And now what wonder is it, if the <hi>Jews</hi> in this humour did neglect, or rather rejected thoſe Apocryphal Books, whoſe Authority in ſome points were ſet up againſt them by the Chriſtians, as were the Books of <hi>Baruch, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Philo,</hi> tho he wrote in a lofty Stile, and after an Allegorical way, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find in the <hi>Rabboth</hi> ſeveral Thoughts common to him and the Cabaliſts, and other Allegorical Authors, whoſe Notions are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the <hi>Rabboth</hi>); yet the <hi>Jews</hi> ſoon loſt all eſteem for his Works. Firſt, Becauſe he writ in <hi>Greek,</hi> which was a Language moſt deſpiſed by them at this time; they having eſtabliſh'd it as a Maxim, That he who brought up his Children in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue was curſed, as he who fed Swine. <hi>Bava ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma fol.</hi> 82. <hi>col.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Sota fol.</hi> 49. <hi>col.</hi> 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe ſome Chriſtians challenged him for their own. For finding ſome of his Principles to be agreeable to thoſe of the Chriſtian Religion, it came into their head (tho it is a Fancy without any Foundation) that he while he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> was converted by St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The ſame thing befel <hi>Joſephus</hi> as ſoon as the Chriſtians began to uſe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> notwithſtanding that the <hi>Jews</hi> have no better Hiſtorian than <hi>Joſephus.</hi> Thirdly, Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> had then almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the ſtudy of the Holy Scriptures, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven themſelves up entirely to the ſtudy of their Traditions, or Second Law, as they call it.
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:93550:211"/> The Catalogue of their Ancient Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators is very ſmall. Their firſt literal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator is <hi>R. Saadiah,</hi> who writ his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Scripture in the beginning of the Tenth Century. As for the others that were long before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Zohar, Siphre,</hi> and <hi>Siphri, Siphra, Mechilta, Tanchuma,</hi> and the <hi>Rabboth,</hi> they all make it their buſineſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain allegorically, or to eſtabliſh their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Targum,</hi> we ſee how heat of Diſpute hath carried the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſuch ſtrange extremities, that now they reject no ſmall part of thoſe Interpretations that were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick with their Forefathers. It may not be amiſs to give ſome Proofs of this, to ſhew that we do not accuſe them without cauſe.</p>
               <p>And in general, there is not a more idle Romance than that which the <hi>Jews</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed touching two <hi>Meſſias's</hi> that are to come unto the World. One muſt be of the Race of <hi>Joſeph</hi> by <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and called <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the Son of <hi>Huſiel,</hi> who (as they will have it) after a Reign of many Years at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and after having ſack'd <hi>Rome,</hi> is at laſt to be killed himſelf at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by a King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The other <hi>Meſſias</hi> is to be <hi>Menahem</hi> the Son of <hi>Hammiel,</hi> who is to appear for the delivery of the <hi>Jews,</hi> being ſent from God on that Errand, according to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayer, <hi>Exod.</hi> iv. 13.</p>
               <p>For the time of this ſecond Meſſias's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhall be when the Mother of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the <hi>Jews</hi> diſperſed from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſhall be there beſieged by one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:93550:212"/> the Son of Satan, who is to proceed out of a Marble Statue in <hi>Rome,</hi> and who in this cloſe Siege ſhall be at the very point of deſtroying them. Then they ſay <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Son of <hi>David</hi> ſhall come with ſeven Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, to wit, the Three Patriarchs, <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and eight of the principal Fathers or Prophets, who are to riſe before the reſt.</p>
               <p>They ſay, That <hi>Moſes</hi> at the head of them ſhall convert the <hi>Jews</hi> without working any Miracle, and then all the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall riſe at the ſound of a Trumpet, paſſing under ground till they come to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> which ſhall cleave in two to, let them out. Then the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall come from all Quarters to form the Meſſias's Army, and the Meſſias the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhall be raiſed from the dead, to come in among the reſt; and ſo the two <hi>Meſſias</hi>'s ſhall reign without jealouſy of one another; only the Son of <hi>David</hi> ſhall have the chief Power, reigning from one end of the Earth to the other, and that for Forty Years.</p>
               <p>All this time the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall continue in Feaſting and Jollity, uſing the other Nations as Slaves: And then <hi>Gog</hi> the King of <hi>Magog,</hi> with the Kingdoms of the <hi>North,</hi> ſhall come to attack the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> but he and they ſhall be deſtroyed by Rain and Hail; after which the Land ſhall be purged of the dead Bodies, and they ſhall build the Third Temple, and then the Ten Tribes ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and offer Sacrifices to God in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and God ſhall pour out his Spirit on all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and make them Prophets, as <hi>Joel</hi> hath foretold, <hi>chap.</hi> xi. 28.</p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:93550:212"/>
               <p>This is the Notion in ſhort of the Two Meſſias's, which <hi>R. Meyr Aldabi</hi> gives us in his Book Intituled <hi>Sevile Emuna, ch.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 123. But it is certain, 1. the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> knew but of one Meſſias. <hi>Trypho</hi> knew not of two, as we ſee in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s Dialogue, which is a clear proof, that thoſe paſſages of the <hi>Targum,</hi> which ſpeak of two Meſſias's, are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the ancient Text, made ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> invented the conceit of a double Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is certain the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve firmly the Return of the Ten Tribes, <hi>Tr. Sanh. c.</hi> 10. §. 3. Some did hope for it, as doth alſo <hi>R. Eliezer Maſſech. Sanh. c.</hi> 30. §. 3. But <hi>R. Akiba</hi> was of quite another opinion. And yet their Poſterity hath been ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined for <hi>R. Eliezer</hi> his opinion, that one of their greateſt Objections againſt Jeſus being the Meſſias, is this, that if he had been the Meſſias, he would have gathered the Ten Tribes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their confining of the Meſſias's Reign to forty years, is contrary to the opinion of their Fathers, who held that the Meſſias ſhould reign for ever. Some afterward thought that he was to reign forty years, others that he was to reign ſeventy years, as you ſee in the <hi>Gemara</hi> of <hi>Sanhedrim, ch.</hi> 11. <hi>fol.</hi> 97. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſuppoſe now that the Meſſias ſhall build a third Temple. Whereas <hi>Haggai</hi> deſcribing the ſecond Temple as that under which the Meſſias ſhould appear, expreſly calls it the laſt, <hi>Hag.</hi> ii. 9. And this <hi>R. David Kimchi</hi> and <hi>R.

                  <hi>Jeruſalem, Megillah, fol.</hi> 72. <hi>col.</hi> 4. The <hi>Talmud</hi> of <hi>Babylon, Tit. Baba batra, fol.</hi> 3. <hi>col.</hi> 1. and ſeveral others do acknowledg. Though ſome few ſuppoſe <hi>Haggai</hi>'s Prophecy to have refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a third Temple. See <hi>Abarbanel &amp; Men. ben Iſrael</hi> on <hi>Hagg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is the remark of one of the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Authors of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and received amongſt the other <hi>Jews,</hi> that all the times noted by the Prophets for the coming of the Meſſias are paſt. <hi>Dixit Rav Omnes termini de adventu Meſſiae tranſierunt, nec jam remanet niſi in converſione, ſi Iſrael convertatur, redimetur, quod ſi non convertatur, non redimetur.</hi> Since that they have been forced to quit that miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhift; and now they maintain that all the Promiſes of the coming of the Meſſias were conditional, and that he ſhall come when his People the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be by Repentance prepared to receive him. <hi>Manaſ. Ben. Iſr. q.</hi> 27. on <hi>Eſ.</hi> And yet the Ancient in the ſame place before did affirm that the Meſſias muſt come in the moſt corrupt Age, <hi>fol.</hi> 97. <hi>col.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>To be a little more particular, the <hi>Jews</hi> did maintain, that all the Prophets ſpoke of the Meſſias. See <hi>Bethlem Juda</hi> in the word <hi>Goel.</hi> At preſent, they diſpute almoſt every Text that we urge for the Meſſias, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of convincing them, we can only ſhame them by laying before them the Authorities of their Fathers, who underſtood theſe Texts in the ſame ſenſe that the Apoſtles did.</p>
               <p>The Modern <hi>Jews</hi> are very ſenſible of the Notion of a Plurality of Perſons in the words, <hi>Let us make Man after our Image, Gen.</hi> i. Some of them therefore are for changing the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:93550:213"/> reading, and inſtead of, <hi>Let Us make Man,</hi> would have it, <hi>Let Man be made,</hi> though the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Text, the Old <hi>Seventy</hi> Verſion, and the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> and all their Ancient and Modern Tranſlations read as we do. See <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> on the place, and <hi>R. David Kimchi</hi> in <hi>Michlol, p.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>They will ſcarcely allow the Meſſias to be ſpoken of in <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. Although <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum,</hi> and that of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> do clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>The Old <hi>Jews</hi> affirmed that the Angel who appeared, <hi>Gen.</hi> xix. and in other places, and who is called the Lord, was (as I have before ſhewed) the Word of the Lord, but many of their Diſciples do ſay it was a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Angel, as we learn from <hi>R. Shem Tov.</hi> in his Book <hi>Emun. &amp; Men. ben Iſrael, q.</hi> 64. on <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Such a thing cannot be done but by an extream impudence, ſince we ſee that they profeſs juſt the contrary in their own Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where you read in their Office of <hi>Peſach, And he brought us out of Egypt;</hi> Not, <hi>ſay they,</hi> by the hand of <hi>an Angel,</hi> neither by the hand of a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> nor by the hand of <hi>an Envoy,</hi> but the <hi>Holy Bleſſed,</hi> by his Glory, and by himſelf, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 12. And ſo there they refer almoſt all the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the <hi>Angel of the Lord,</hi> to <hi>God</hi> himſelf, excluſively, to any created Angel: And ſuch are thoſe Appearances, <hi>Gen.</hi> xiv. 15. <hi>Gen.</hi> xx. 6. <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxi. 24. <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxii. 24. where <hi>they ſay</hi> that <hi>Iſrael</hi> wreſtled with God. <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſent <hi>Jews</hi> are not for applying the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. to the Meſſias, but ſome
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:93550:214"/> refer the words to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, as <hi>R.

               <p>And thus in the ſame Text, the Scepter there ſpoken of was explained in the Old <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſts</hi> by Power and Dominion which ſhould not depart from <hi>Judah</hi> till the coming of the Meſſias; Though now among ſome of the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> it ſignifies only Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Calamities. <hi>R.

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's time, did believe the xxiid. <hi>Pſalm</hi> to be a Prophecy touching the Meſſias.

                  <hi>Jonathan</hi> in his Paraphraſe on <hi>Iſa.</hi> ix. 6. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets the Text of the Meſſias: <hi>For unto us
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:93550:215"/> a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and his Name ſhall be called, Wonderful, Counſeller, the mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> And ſo did the moſt ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers. But after Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broken up a new way, it has pleaſed ſome of their late Writers to tread in the ſteps of <hi>R. Hillel,</hi> and to apply it to <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> So does <hi>Salomon Jarchi, David Kimchi, Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezra</hi> and <hi>Lipman.</hi> As for the reſt they quite change the preſent Text by referring to God all the Names, which are evidently given to the Meſſias, except that of the Prince of Peace.</p>
               <p>For much the ſame reaſon do the latter <hi>Jews</hi> make <hi>Zorobabel</hi> to be ſpoken of in <hi>Iſa.</hi> xi. 12. <hi>Manaſ. q.</hi> 18. on <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Though not only St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood it of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 12. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> ii. 8. But the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> did generally refer it to the Meſſias, as appears all along in the <hi>Targum</hi> of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhewed they underſtood it ſo, by their rejecting <hi>Barcochba,</hi> when they found he could not ſmell Souls as they thought the Meſſias ſhould do according to the ſecond verſe of the ſaid Chapter. And St. <hi>Jerome</hi> witneſſes upon that Chapter that all the <hi>Jews</hi> agreed with Chriſtians, that all that Chapter was to be underſtood of the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>The old <hi>Jews,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> witneſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Chapter, aſcribed <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxv. 6. <hi>Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf be unſtopped. Then ſhall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing; for in the wilderneſs ſhall waters break out, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:93550:216"/> ſtreams in the deſert,</hi> to the times of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</p>
               <p>But the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> have endeavoured to wreſt it, and to make it agree to other times, becauſe they ſaw how the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> applied it to the Miracles of our Lord. See <hi>Menaſſ. q.</hi> 17. on <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> And they are gone ſo far in that fancy that they give it out now for an Axiom amongſt their People, that the Meſſias ſhall not work any Miracle. So <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam. R. Meyr Aldab.</hi> and <hi>R. Menaſſ. ben Iſrael,</hi> who would have the Miracles which are there ſpoken of, either to be underſtood Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, or to be referred, to the time of the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>The Impudence of <hi>R. Salomon</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlviii. 48, 16. is amazing: The words of the Text run thus, <hi>From the time that it was, there am I, and now the Lord God and his Spirit have ſent me.</hi> From hence it appears that the Meſſias, who is here ſpoken of, according to the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> was on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when God gave the Law from thence. This <hi>R. Salomon</hi> will by no means grant of the Meſſias, but affirms that it is ſpoken of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> But how was he on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> when the Law was given? Why, he anſwers, His Soul was there, as were the Souls alſo of all the Prophets, God then revealing to them all thoſe things that were to come, which each of them in his time have ſince Propheſied of. A fancy, that <hi>R. Tanchuma,</hi> who lived a long while before <hi>R. Salomon,</hi> never hit on: For he maintains from <hi>Iſa.</hi> lvii. 16. that the Souls are then crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as God orders Men to be born in every Generation.</p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:93550:216"/>
               <p>We ſee how poſitive they are in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sufferings of the Meſſias, which are deſcribed <hi>Iſa.</hi> liii. of the People of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And yet they can't but know that <hi>Jonathan</hi> refers the end of the lii. <hi>Chap.</hi> and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the liii. to the Meſſias, as the Apoſtles refer it to Jeſus Chriſt, following herein <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, Joh.</hi> i. 29. And ſo did <hi>R. Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dri</hi> among the <hi>Talmudiſt,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin, fol.</hi> 93. <hi>col.</hi> 2. and in the <hi>Midraſh Conen</hi> in <hi>Arze Levanon, fol.</hi> 3. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Micah, ch.</hi> v. 2. ſpeaks of the Meſſias: <hi>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Iſrael; whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from everlaſting.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> can't deny this. But then to evade what is there ſpoken of his Eternity, they pretend it means no more than his deſcent from <hi>David;</hi> as if the diſtance of time from <hi>David</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt could be called Eternity. This is the way <hi>Manaſſeh ben Iſrael, q.</hi> 5. on <hi>Micah,</hi> takes to get over this difficulty. Before him others took another way, and affirmed that God decreed before the Creation of the World, to ſend the Meſſias, and that in this reſpect it is ſaid in <hi>Micah,</hi> that <hi>his goings forth are from the days of eternity.</hi>

                  <hi>Jeremy, ch.</hi> xxiii. 26. ſaith very expreſly, that the Meſſias ſhall be called the <hi>Jehovah,</hi> our Righteouſneſs; and he repeats the ſame, <hi>ch.</hi> xxxiii. 15, 16. <hi>In thoſe days, and at that time will I cauſe the Branch of Righteouſneſs to grow up unto David, and he ſhall execute judgment and righteouſneſs in the Land. In thoſe days ſhall Judah
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:93550:217"/> be ſaved, and Jeruſalem ſhall dwell ſafely: And this is the Name wherewith he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs. R. David Kimchi</hi> owns it, and quotes the Authority of two Eminent <hi>Rabbins</hi> for it, namely, <hi>R. Aba Bar Caana,</hi> and <hi>R. Levi in Eccha Rabati.</hi> But they will none of them own that this Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> belongs any otherwiſe to him, than it doth to the Ark; which is altogether impertinent; for the Ark is never called <hi>Jehovah;</hi> nor doth <hi>Menaſſeh</hi> prove that it is with all his talking, <hi>q.</hi> 18. in <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jonathan,</hi> as well as <hi>Philo,</hi> aſcribes to the Meſſias the Prophecies, <hi>Zech.</hi> vi. 12, 13. And ſo <hi>Jonathan</hi> applies to the Meſſias what is ſaid in the ſame Prophet. But many of the Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> among whom <hi>R. Salomon</hi> is one, do refer them to <hi>Zorobabel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral places I have now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may ſerve as a Sample of the confuſion the <hi>Jews</hi> are in, while they attempt to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the ancient Prophecies; and I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm, that all thoſe other places which I have omitted, that intimate a Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the Divinity of the Meſſias, or the time when he ſhould come into the World, are in like manner explained ſo very trifling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and forcedly, as that oftentimes their own Authors, convinced by the Evidence of the Texts themſelves, have refuted them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a new Interpretation of them. Whence it comes to paſs, that their Reader can find no certain ſenſe of thoſe Texts to reſt on, but his underſtanding continues in an entire darkneſs, and unſetledneſs.</p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:93550:217"/>
               <p>This ill luck they have of Explications, is not of yeſterday, as I have already obſerved. Soon after Jeſus Chriſt's time, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to oppoſe what the Chriſtians held of the two Comings of the Meſſias, though ſo diſtinctly deſcribed, one of them <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. 9. and the other, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13. And ſtill to this day do they reject that Notion of his two Comings, as may be ſeen in <hi>Menaſſ.</hi> on <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. <hi>p.</hi> 185.</p>
               <p>But others of them, who found it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deny that the Scripture ſpeaks of two Comings of the Meſſias, whom they expected, thought it better to make two Meſſias's, than to acknowledg that the Meſſias whom they expected was to be a ſuffering Meſſias. And thus they thought they removed the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the other opinion, that made but one Coming of the Meſſias, by owning the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould be a Man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, but Meſſias the Son of <hi>David</hi> was to be a Glorious Deliverer.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Jews</hi> Diſputes with the Chriſtians encreaſed, they advanced certain Characters of the Times of the Meſſias; and all of them very miraculous; which they inferred from ſome Allegorical Deſcriptions in the Prophets concerning the Times of the Meſſias. Theſe they run up to ten, as we ſee in <hi>Shemoth Rabba, Paraſcha</hi> 15. And they make a great uſe of thoſe Miracles, which they conceive ſhould have been in the time of Jeſus Chriſt, if he had been the true Meſſias. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all which <hi>Menaſſe q.</hi> 7. on <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> finds himſelf obliged to aſſure us that <hi>David Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> and <hi>Abarbanel,</hi> and many Interpreters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:93550:218"/> moſt of theſe paſſages as Allegorical Deſcriptions of the Times of the Meſſias. And <hi>Maimonides</hi> is of this opinion, that when the Meſſias comes there ſhall be no change in the Order of Nature, <hi>Jad Chaz. Lib. de Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> And in that he follows the opinion of one <hi>Rabbi Samuel</hi> that is quoted in the <hi>Talmud Tit. Beracoth,</hi> where he ſaith that there ſhall be not any difference between the Times of the Meſſias, and the other Times of the World, but the ſubduing of the Kingdoms by the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the <hi>Jews</hi> being ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their Expectations of the Meſſias, and finding themſelves abuſed by a great number of falſe pretenders to that Character, have almoſt loſt their hopes of his Coming: And finding his Coming to be a thing uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, few of them do regard the Promiſe of the Meſſias, with that aſſurance with which the Ancients did expect it.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is obſervable that though <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> profeſſes to own the Meſſias, and hath inſerted the hope of it among the Articles of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith, which he hath given us; yet he otherwhere ſpeaks very indifferently of it. In one place he aſſerts the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and the recompenſes annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, to be the chief end of the <hi>Jews</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and not the time of the Meſſias's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; as we are informed by the Author of the Chain of the <hi>Cabala.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame judgment may be made of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Albo,</hi> who writ with great bitterneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians: For, 1. he maintains in his Book of the Principles that <hi>R. Hillel</hi> was
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:93550:218"/> no Apoſtate, though he denied the coming of any other Meſſias, but of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who was already come. And <hi>Albo</hi> gives this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, becauſe the Coming of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as is no Fundamental Article of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. <hi>Orat.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. Nothing can be more wretched than this excuſe of his. For if the Meſſias had come before the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, as <hi>R. Hillel</hi> would have it in the Perſon of King <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and if no other was to be expected, why did the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church take thoſe Books into her Bible that were written by the Prophets that lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſecond Temple? and why did not <hi>R. Hillel</hi> and his Followers declare againſt them as falſe Prophecies, that ſpoke of the Meſſias as being yet to come? namely, <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary, Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> who did all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the Meſſias, as has been abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn, with Proofs out of the <hi>Targums</hi> of thoſe Books, and the general conſent of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame <hi>Albo</hi> is not afraid to aſſert, That the Article of the Meſſias, has no other foundation than the authority of Tradition. For, ſaith he, there is not any Prophecy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Law, or in the Prophets, that foretells his Coming by any neceſſary Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it, with reſpect to him, or which may not from the circumſtances of the Text be well explained otherwiſe. This is his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in examination of <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. where he doth his utmoſt to evade the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He looks on the Article of the Meſſias's Coming to be a matter of that ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:93550:219"/> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he leaves it doubtful, whether the Meſſias be come ſince the time of <hi>Onkelos</hi> their famous Paraphraſt, who expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his expectation of this Promiſe in many places of the Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and if he be not already come, whether he ſhall come in the Glory of the Clouds of Heaven, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall come poor, and riding on an Aſs; and becauſe of Men's ſins, not diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting thoſe great Bleſſings promiſed at his Coming, nor Men on the other hand regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as the Meſſias?</p>
               <p>Certainly, <hi>R. Lipman</hi> in his <hi>Nitzachon,</hi> where he examines the above mentioned Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. advances a Rule which quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all Proofs from the Holy Scripture. This <hi>Rabin,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Jews</hi> give ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Interpretations of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Scepter's continuance in <hi>Judah,</hi> as were impoſſible to be reconciled, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Empire, by the Scepter; and ſome Slavery and oppreſſion; he lays this down for a Maxim, That the Law was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of divers Explications, and all of them, though never ſo incompatible and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, were nevertheleſs the words of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</p>
               <p>This is very near the Sentiment of <hi>R. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> in his Queſtions on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where he collects the ſeveral <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Text. But granting this once for a Principle, it is in vain to conſult the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or to think of ever diſcovering the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. The ſenſe of them muſt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend on the Authority of the <hi>Rabins;</hi> and what they teach muſt be all equally received
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:93550:219"/> as the Word of God, though they teach things contradictory to one another. Such Poſitions put one to a loſs, whether their blindneſs, or their ſpite, is therein moſt to be pitied.</p>

               <p>WHAT I have obſerved of the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> in their Belief, is enough to ſhew that they were forced to adopt new Notions, becauſe of the evident Proofs drawn from the Opinions of their Anceſtors, which the Chriſtians uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>The very ſame prevarication may be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in their Explications of thoſe places of Scripture, that prove the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, and the Divinity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>And, 1ſt. They have borrowed many of the <hi>Jews</hi> anſwers to the Chriſtians, and often carried them much further than the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves did intend them. 2dly.

<pb n="414" facs="tcp:93550:220"/> they can no other way reſolve. 3dly. The <hi>Unitarians,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> to make ſhort work, do not ſtick to aſſert, that the Chriſtians have foiſted thoſe Texts into the Goſpel, which ſpeak of the Trinity, and the Divinity of our Lord.</p>

               <p>Then in particular: When we would prove a Plurality of Perſons in the Deity againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> from thoſe Expreſſions of Scripture that ſpeak of God in the Plural Number; although the <hi>Jews</hi> (as you may ſee in their Comments on <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 26. xi. 7. and eſpecially on <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 8.) are forced to own that a Plurality is imported in thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and therefore pretend that the Number is Plural, becauſe God ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Angels his Counſellors; yet the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as <hi>Enjedinus</hi> witneſſes for them, do deny that theſe Plural Expreſſions do denote any Plurality in the Deity, no more than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the Singular Number do. As for <hi>Socinus,</hi> he ſolves it by a Figure, by which, as he ſaith, a ſingle Perſon ſpeaks plurally when he excites himſelf to do any thing.

               <p>But this is not all.

               <p>They go further than the <hi>Jews</hi> do on <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlv. 6. <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> A Text cited by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and applied to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 7, 8. The LXX tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate

As for <hi>Socinus,</hi> he pretends to reject the <hi>Jews</hi> Solutions. But his Diſciples have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented another, which is worſe than that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as may be ſeen in <hi>Enjedinus</hi> and <hi>Oſtorodius.</hi>

                  <hi>Pſalm.</hi> xc. throughout relates to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt applies it to himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxii. and from thence proves that he is <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, although he is the Son of <hi>David.</hi> But <hi>Enjedinus</hi> refutes this Argument of Jeſus Chriſt: And <hi>Schlichtingius</hi> treats it as abſurd. This is a thing that deſerves to be reflected on; becauſe theſe Gentlemen pretend that among them only true Chriſtianity is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</p>
               <p>The like way they take to anſwer what the Apoſtle ſaith of Chriſt's creating the Heavens and the Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 10, 11. and his Proof of it from <hi>Pſal.</hi> cii. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>And with the ſame Impudence do they elude the Citation from <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxviii. 22. which is quoted Mat. xxi. 42. Altho <hi>R. D. Kimchi,</hi> among other <hi>Jews,</hi> refers it to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>

                  <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> xxxv. 5. has diſtinctly noted the Miracles which the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould work, and has given us a clear Character of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>R.

               <p>How audaciouſly does <hi>Crellius</hi> deſtroy the Proof of the Place where Chriſt ſhould be born, <hi>Matth.</hi> ii. 5. taken out of <hi>Micah</hi> v. 2.?

               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:93550:222"/>
               <p>We have a remarkable Prophecy for the Proof of the Divinity of the Meſſias, in <hi>Zech.</hi> xii. 10. <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> anciently did, and ſtill do, underſtand it of the Meſſias. And Jeſus Chriſt does apply it to himſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 7. What ſaith <hi>Socinus</hi> to this? He declares that this Text which is ſo like <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxii. has been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thus he trys to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Authority uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Here you have a Sample of their conduct, in rejecting the Literal, and ſetting up a Myſtical ſenſe: But there are other Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cited in the New Teſtament, from which it is manifeſt that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the God ſpoken of in the Old Teſtament, the Authority of which Texts cannot ſo eaſily be eluded. And to take away the evidence of theſe, they have invented the way of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> has theſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxviii. 19. <hi>Thou art aſcended on high, &amp;c.</hi> Hence we conclude that Jeſus Chriſt is the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith they had their accompliſhment in our Lord's Aſcenſion into Heaven, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. 8. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, thoſe words in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> were ſpoken of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> cannot deny they were ſpoken of God; but deny they were ſpoken of the Meſſias literally. But, ſay they, theſe words were applied to Jeſus Chriſt by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> only by way of accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Strange! Is it not plain, that <hi>David</hi> ſaith no more in this lxviii. <hi>Pſalm</hi> of the Meſſias, than he ſaith in <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. which the <hi>Jews</hi> do refer to the Meſſias? Is not the calling of the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:93550:223"/> Gentiles here clearly foretold <hi>v.</hi> 33, 34. which is owned on all hands to be the work of the Meſſias? Is it not then viſible that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in citing theſe words has followed the ſenſe of the Ancient Synagogue, who underſtood <hi>Pſal.</hi> cx. of the Meſſias, according to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> owns that the words <hi>Pſal.</hi> xcvii. 7. which are applied to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 6. do reſpect the Supreme God. He cannot therefore deny Jeſus Chriſt to be the Supreme God to whom they are applied. But he does it, as he pleaſes, by this way of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which he ſaith the Sacred Author uſed in applying this Text to Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo the Adoration commanded to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, terminates not in him, but is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable to the Supreme God who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Adoration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſa. ch.</hi> viii. 13, 14. has theſe words, <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> interpret them of the Meſſias. <hi>Gemar. Maſſech. Sanhedr. in ch.</hi> iv. and they are cited by St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> ix. 32. St. <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 34. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 7. who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> whoſe Cauſe will not bear this, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be called the Lord of Hoſts, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deny that the Maſſias is here treated of, or that any one elſe is here meant, but God only; adding, that the Holy Writers of the New Teſtament, in applying them to Jeſus Chriſt, turned theſe Texts to quite another ſenſe than was intended by the Holy Spirit at the inditing of them.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> again has theſe words, <hi>ch.</hi> xxxv. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Behold your God will come—
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:93550:223"/> and ſave you, &amp;c. Sal Jarchi</hi> and <hi>D. Kimchi,</hi> expound them of the Deliverance from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> contrary to the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> opinion, who, as theſe <hi>Rabbins</hi> confeſs, underſtood them of the Meſſias. The <hi>Socinians</hi> will not deny that Jeſus Chriſt aſſumed them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to ſhew how little ground he had for ſo doing, they inſiſt on it, that he only accommodated the words to himſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Iſaiah</hi> writes thus, <hi>ch.</hi> xli. 4. <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt;</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt has the ſame expreſſions of himſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 17. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt thought they belonged ſo properly to the True God, as to Paraphraſe them in this manner, <hi>I am the Lord Jehovah who created the World in the beginning, and the Ages to come are all mine. Joſeph Albo</hi> makes this Text a proof of the Eternity of God, and notes that it is a parallel Text to <hi>Iſa.</hi> xliv. 6. But if you'l have <hi>Socinus</hi> opinion of the place, when it is applied to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it does not at all regard his Eternity.</p>
               <p>Once more, we read <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlv. 23. <hi>I have ſworn by my ſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs — that unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> refers theſe words to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 11. nay he proves our ſtanding before Chriſt's Judgment-ſeat by this Quotation. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Socinians</hi> believe them only a ſimple accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, and not the prime ſcope of the Text.</p>
               <p>I know the Apoſtles have ſometimes cited Texts from the Old Teſtament, which have not their exact accompliſhment in that ſenſe wherein they are uſed. As for example, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:93550:224"/> viii. 15. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to ſupply the <hi>wants of their Brethren with their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,</hi> addeth, <hi>As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over, and he that had gathered little had no lack.</hi> Thus alluding to the Hiſtory of the <hi>Manna, Exod.</hi> xvi. 18. it is plain that he accommodates that Story to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the Chriſtians, without any thing, either from Letter, or Allegory, to juſtifie this accommodation.</p>
               <p>They who think that <hi>John, ch.</hi> xix. 37. does allude to <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 46. <hi>Neither ſhall you break a bone thereof,</hi> go upon this ground, that Chriſt was typified by the Paſchal Lamb, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what was ſpoken of the Paſchal Lamb is truly applicable to Chriſt. But ſome others believe that St. <hi>John</hi> cited this paſſage from <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxiv. 21. and applies what <hi>David</hi> ſaith of all the juſt in general, to the Meſſias, who is often called the Juſt One, as being eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo.</p>
               <p>I know that ſome think that a Prophecy which has been already accompliſh'd literally, was accommodated by the Holy Penmen to a like event. And thus they think St. <hi>Matthew, ch.</hi> ii. 17. applies the voice that was heard at <hi>Ramah,</hi> and <hi>Rachel</hi>'s weeping for her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to thoſe Expreſſions of ſorrow uſed by the Women of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> when <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew their Children: Although this Prophecy was before accompliſhed in the Captivity of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides what I have ſaid upon ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Examples of this nature are but few, and thoſe may be eaſily diſcerned by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reader from ſuch Citations as are not
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:93550:224"/> Accommodations, but Proofs; and for the Texts which are commonly and generally quoted by the Holy Writers, they expoſe the Books of the New Teſtament to the ſcorn and contempt of <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſuppoſe that the Apoſtles went about to make Converts from the Synagogue by ſuch paſſages of the Old Teſtament, as had nothing of ſtrength or reaſon to convince any Man, for ſuch are the places quoted by way of Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and let any one but conſult the Writings of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt Chriſtianity, and he will find that the main Argument they make uſe of againſt the Proofs brought by the Apoſtles, is, that the paſſages they cite, were never deſigned by the Spirit, to that purpoſe Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken, but were only made uſe of by them by way of Accommodation.</p>
               <p>But the moſt wonderful thing of all in the <hi>Unitarians</hi> management of this Controverſie, eſpecially in our <hi>Engliſh Unitarians</hi> is this, that they do not only ſide with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and dreſs up their ſenſe of thoſe Texts of the Old Teſtament which are cited in the New as Proofs of our Lords Divinity; or which are objected in confirmation of the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that they have not been content to bring in the Notion of Accommodation to elude the force of thoſe Quotations on which the Apoſtles grounded ſeveral Doctrines; but for the moſt part they give broad intimations, as if the New Teſtament Writings were on purpoſe falſified by the Chriſtians, and many things there inſerted which were never thought of by the Authors of thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:93550:225"/>
               <p>If they could have made good this accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would have ſaved them a great deal of pains which it has coſt them to find out Anſwers to the ſeveral Objections propoſed to them. 'Tis the moſt eaſie, natural, and ſhorteſt way to joyn with the <hi>Deiſts</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Authority of the Goſpel, and to endeavour to ſhew that nothing certain can be drawn from thence, ſeeing that ſince the Apoſtles Times the Chriſtian Faith hath been corrupted, and new Doctrines have been foiſted into their Books, which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were not there.</p>
               <p>For my part I ſee no other way left them for the defence of their bad Cauſe. But by ill luck, <hi>Socinus</hi> has ſtopped their retreat even to this laſt Refuge, by the Treatiſe he writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Authority of the Holy Scriptures. When they have ſolidly refuted this Book of their great Leader, it will be then time to take their Charge againſt the Sacred Books into more particular conſideration.</p>
               <p>Let them do this when they will. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them when they have done it, to reproach them no more with <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Authority, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Integrity of the Scripture. But for the preſent we refer them to the Book of a famous <hi>Mahometan</hi> called <hi>Hazzadaula,</hi> who has handled this matter with length and force enough to confound both the <hi>Unitarians</hi> and <hi>Deiſts.</hi> I mean his third Book of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the three Laws, the <hi>Jewiſh, Chriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Mahometan;</hi> of which there is an Extract in <hi>Joſ. de Voiſin de Lege Divina,</hi> in a Letter from <hi>Gabriel Syonita.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:93550:225"/>
               <p>It has been thought by ſome, that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> and his Followers did accuſe the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians of corrupting the Old and New Teſtament Writings. But we ſee this Accuſation is proved falſe by ſuch as have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Controverſie againſt <hi>Mahometaniſm.</hi> And the more knowing <hi>Mahometans</hi> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Chriſtian Miſſionaries for charging it on them, when <hi>Mahomet</hi> accuſed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians only for wreſting ſeveral paſſages in Scripture, and putting a falſe and forced ſenſe on them.</p>
               <p>But with what face the <hi>Mahometans</hi> can object this I know not, when they themſelves do ſo groſly pervert the paſſages in <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiii. 33. <hi>Hab.</hi> iii. 3. <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. and xxxiv. in favour of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his Law; and in favour of <hi>Mahomet</hi> only many Texts in <hi>Iſaiah, Ezekiel, Zephany,</hi> and other Prophets, as you may ſee them alledged by <hi>Hazzadaula</hi> in his Fourth Book; but eſpecially when they urge all thoſe places in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, where the Paraclete is ſpoken of, as ſo many Promiſes of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s coming.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs ſome warm indiſcreet <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> in diſpute with the Chriſtians have given them occaſion to believe that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> generally accuſed the Chriſtians with falſifying their Scriptures. Juſt as the petty Controvertiſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have impudently averred the Scripture to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in many places, the better to eſtabliſh their Church's Authority. And thus we find <hi>Ahmed</hi> the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> charging both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with altering of their Bibles. <hi>Hotting. Hiſt. p.</hi> 364.</p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:93550:226"/>
               <p>But as there are in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Men wiſer and calmer that ſee the conſequences of ſo raſh an Accuſation, and have therefore proved unanſwerably the Integrity of the Sacred Text; ſo are there among the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> more wary and cautious Diſputants, who deſpiſe and diſallow thoſe falſe Charges advanced by ſome of their party againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zadaula</hi> in the Book before cited, who ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves that by the care the <hi>Maſorite Jews</hi> took to aſcertain the Text of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was impoſſible they ſhould be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to corrupt it; and that if they had been willing, yet they were divided into ſo many Sects of unreconcileable hatred to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as rendred it impoſſible for them to do it.</p>
               <p>He then ſhews that the difference which is between the ſeveral Verſions, as between the <hi>Seventy</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> for Example, was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Purity of the Text it ſelf; but that this aroſe from the ſeveral Views the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters then had, from the different Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſenſes they affixed to the Original words. He then paſſes to the Examination of the various Readings, which our <hi>Unitarians</hi> triumph in; and ſhews that neither their number nor variety ought to diminiſh the Authority of the Originals. He gives Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his preference of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Bible to that of the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> He proves the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Books of the Old Teſtament could not be made before Jeſus Chriſt's time, ſince he never reproached them for it, which he would certainly have done, had they been
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:93550:226"/> guilty of it; nor could the corruption come in after Chriſt's time, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who are ſuch mortal Enemies, have had theſe Books in keeping, and daily read them, though they interpret them very differently.</p>
               <p>In a word, we cannot eaſily meet with a more perfect Treatiſe on this Subject, nor one more proper to refute the bold inſinuations of ſome who under the name of Chriſtians, and Men skilled in Critical knowledg, have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to ſhake the Foundations of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; and for this purpoſe would diſcredit the Authority of the Holy Scripture, under the diſguiſe of making it reſt on the Authority of Tradition.</p>
               <p>The Reader will, I hope, reflect on what I have ſaid concerning the conduct of the <hi>Socinians</hi> in their Diſputes with us, relating to the Divinity of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To which I may add, that ſome of them, leſs modeſt, though more ſincere than <hi>Socinus,</hi> being convinced that no Anſwer could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Quotations from the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that were uſed in Proof of our Lord's Divinity, thought fit to reject the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which contains thoſe Quotations, as an <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Piece. This <hi>Enjedinus</hi> has done, and thought it a quick way to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at once of many difficulties, from which otherwiſe he could not extricate himſelf. For had he believed <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Anſwers Satisfactory, he had never betaken himſelf to this laſt and deſperate ſhift.</p>
               <p>Others, of whom Mr. <hi>N.</hi> is one, do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that whatever makes for the advantage
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:93550:227"/> of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> Cauſe <hi>is all forged.</hi> And ſo they abandon the fanciful Explications <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> has given of the firſt Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, as having no need of them, ſo long as they can make one believe that the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> have foiſted into the New Teſtament whatever they pleaſed. This is ſtill a ſhorter anſwer than the former. The firſt rendred one particular Book only, uſeleſs to the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians;</hi> but this makes all thoſe Books of the New Teſtament uſeleſs, from whence any Objection may be drawn againſt the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What end the <hi>Socinians</hi> have in theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous attempts, whether to facilitate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as they pretend, or to do ſervice to the Atheiſts and <hi>Deiſts,</hi> as it ſeems to be their real deſign, is worthy every Chriſtian's ſerious enquiry. If they intend the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> we may well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them what way they will take to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. <hi>Smalcius,</hi> one of their chief Writers, has affirmed that the Books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are of little uſe to convert the <hi>Jews. De Div. Chr. c.</hi> x. already quoted. His reaſon is, becauſe if we interpret any Text in the Old Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it Myſtically, that is, according to quite another ſenſe than that which the words do naturally import. And now admitting this to be true, what uſe can a <hi>Socinian</hi> make of the Old Teſtament againſt the <hi>Jews?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sommerus,</hi> and <hi>Francis David,</hi> (whoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as to the denial of the Worſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, are embraced by Mr. <hi>N.</hi>) being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to own that the Author of the Book of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:93550:227"/> 
                  <hi>Proverbs</hi> did aſcribe a Son to God, <hi>ch.</hi> xxx. 4. and yet being not willing to acknowledg it as a truth, took the readieſt way to defeat the Authority of this Book, and placed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Writings. One ſhould wonder how ſuch <hi>Socinians</hi> are like to be Converters, who call the <hi>Jews</hi> Canon of the Scriptures into queſtion, and conſequently leave no Books from whence, as from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principle, they may on each ſide deduce their reaſonings.</p>
               <p>As for the Books of the New Teſtament, what uſe can they make of them? Yes, very great, ſaith the <hi>Socinian.</hi> If the Books of the New Teſtament were reformed, and thoſe Patches intirely taken from them, which were never written by the Apoſtles, though added under their Names, ſuch as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which was brought in after the year 140. of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſtuffed with Doctrines of a Trinity, and Chriſt's Divinity, contrary to the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Primitive Chriſtians; then we might hope to have ſucceſs in the Converſion of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in truth they are not likely to ſucceed with their reformed <hi>Socinian</hi> Goſpel, ſo well as they would have us believe: For 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think that every <hi>Jew</hi> of common ſenſe would retort the Book on themſelves, and tell them frankly, This is not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Goſpel from whence you offer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, this is a Book of no Authority, but an Impoſture, of which you are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We <hi>Jews</hi> who are ſpread throughout all parts of the World, and are intermingled
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:93550:228"/> among Chriſtians of all Perſuaſions, never yet met with theſe Books, ſuch as you now produce them, to ſhew that Jeſus is the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</p>
               <p>You tell us, they were corrupted by the Chriſtians of the ſecond Age: Produce Copies more ancient, as Vouchers of this Truth. The Books which you contend were falſified, are of no Authority. What other Books have you beſides theſe falſified Books, to prove there ever was ſuch a Man as Jeſus Chriſt, who did and ſuffered what you tell us of? Since you accuſe theſe Books of Additions, and defalcations, and all ſorts of corruption, you have no ſolid proof for the matters in them, which you ſay are true. They who thus falſified the Scriptures, by adding and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting as they pleaſe, or rather you your ſelves by advancing this Poſition, have ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all uſe that might be made of theſe Books in Points controverted between us.</p>
               <p>Thus much it is natural for a <hi>Jew</hi> of but an ordinary capacity to ſay, and to quote his <hi>Tanchuma,</hi> and all the <hi>Rabins</hi> who have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ever ſince there were Chriſtians, againſt the Goſpel, on the ſcore of their attributing Divinity to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Tanchuma</hi> is a famous Book among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and has a paſſage in it in the <hi>Paraſcha va-elle Maſſahe,</hi> which the <hi>Italian</hi> Inquiſitors blot out of all thoſe Books which the <hi>Jews</hi> Printed by <hi>Bomberg</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi> But this paſſage is ſtill preſerved, and is to this effect, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom they call wicked <hi>Balaam,</hi> taught that he was God, and on the contrary, <hi>R. Tanchuma</hi> argues that he was a meer Man.</p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:93550:228"/>
               <p>But ſhould we call into the Diſpute a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jew,</hi> that underſtands the Original, and the meaning of his Prayers, he would laugh in the face of a <hi>Socinian</hi> that ſhould go about to perſuade him, that Jeſus is not repreſented in the Goſpels as God, or that the Chriſtians were not of this belief till after the 140th. year after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And good reaſon for it: The Learned <hi>Jews</hi> know well, that the Prayer which in the Chriſtian Countries is called the Prayer againſt the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and in other Countries the Prayer againſt the <hi>Minnim,</hi> the Hereticks and Apoſtates, was truly and originally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt the Chriſtians, for being Teachers of a Trinity, and of Chriſt's. Divinity, and ſo as they judged, deſtroyers of the Unity of the Godhead. And this is <hi>R. Solomon</hi>'s ſenſe of that Prayer in his Notes on the <hi>Talmud.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> otherwiſe know that this Prayer was compoſed under <hi>R.

D.</hi> 139. who mentions this Prayer, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Curſe, againſt the Chriſtians, as already ſpread and received throughout all the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of the World.</p>
               <p>Our Learned <hi>Jew</hi> deriding theſe <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> would repreſent that he knew not how they could refuſe Jeſus Chriſt that Worſhip which the Chriſtians ever ſince the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel throughout the World have paid him, on ſuppoſition of his being
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:93550:229"/> the true God. He reads how his Anceſtors ſaw him adored by the Chriſtians in the firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and he proves it to the <hi>Socinians</hi> from the <hi>Talmud</hi>

               <p>In a word, any <hi>Jew</hi> who has ſenſe enough to reflect on it, may ſee that the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Jeſus Chriſt as the Object of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Worſhip. And not to mention now their other prejudices; The ſingle prejudice which will be taken againſt ſuch a <hi>Socinian</hi> Novel-Goſpel, will tend more to make them diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem the Goſpel, and reject it altogether, than it will diſpoſe them to attend to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of a <hi>Socinian</hi> drawn thence in behalf of Chriſtianity. Theſe things I leave to the conſideration of our <hi>Socinians.</hi> For other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they ſee whither the <hi>Socinian</hi> Methods of treating Scripture lead, and cannot but behold with ſorrow the wounds they give to the Chriſtian Religion, under pretence of making it more apt to gain the <hi>Jews,</hi> but in truth making it ſo ridiculous to Men of any ordinary capacity, that we cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their not having after all their boaſts, converted ſo much as one <hi>Jew</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.</p>

            <p>YOU do very truly obſerve that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our laſt but ſhort Converſation, is a matter of the greateſt moment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the utmoſt care in the diſcuſſion of it.

            <p>But having not time to hear the Grounds of my Aſſertion, you were deſirous I ſhould put them with what perſpicuity I could into writing, in hopes that the ſame Arguments, if they ſhould prove cogent to bring you over to my opinion, might be of uſe to others who were in the ſame Sentiments with your ſelf. So good an end being propoſed, I ſet my ſelf without delay to your commands; and having digeſted my thoughts in this Paper, I now ſend them to you, intreating you to judge of them, as you are wont of the Labours of your Friend, with all impartiality and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

               <p>In Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion we need not be much to ſeek: For <hi>Onkelos</hi> in his <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> Paraphraſe Expounds the word <gap reason="foreign">

How ſhould they? ſince it is evident to them that conſider this Text carefully, as the Chriſtians generally do the Holy Scriptures, that theſe <hi>Targumiſts</hi> have herein faithfully expreſt the mind of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> had been newly remembring that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in which God had bleſſed him at <hi>Luz,</hi> in theſe words,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſis</hi> xlviii. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and bleſſed me, and ſaid, Behold I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people, and will give this land to thy ſeed after thee for an everlaſting poſſeſſion.</hi> Now what can be more abſurd than to imagin, that <hi>Jacob</hi> when he bleſſes <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Sons, and prays for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:93550:231"/> of his Poſterity by them, ſhould direct his Prayers to any other than him whoſe kindneſſes he had ſo abundantly experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whoſe Promiſes for the multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſeed, were even now freſh in his Memory?</p>
               <p>This I thought fit to obſerve againſt thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> that doubt it, following as they think the Author of the Book <hi>Rabboth,</hi> who notes that a leſſer Title is given to the Angel, than to him that is call'd <hi>Elohim;</hi> as if he had a mind thereby to<note n="*" place="margin">Matthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Kehun. f. <hi>23.</hi> col. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; f. <hi>108.</hi> col. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> tell us that by the Angels here mention'd, <hi>Jacob</hi> intended an Angel and not God.</p>
               <p>If the Author of the <hi>Rabboth</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this of a created Angel, he had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been in a very great miſtake. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the abſurdity of this, it is a wicked thing to ſuppoſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> did walk before the Angel, as <hi>Jacob</hi> aſſerts they did before God. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>before whom my fathers Abraham and Iſaac did walk.</hi> For the word <hi>walk</hi> in this place comprehends all the acts of their Religion throughout their whole lives, and ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> uſes the word to deſcribe the intire obedience of <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> v. 22. This a Modern <hi>Jew, R.

                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:93550:233"/> in his Notes on the <hi>Acts, ch.</hi> 7. ſays, it is a difficult queſtion among Divines, whether God's Appearances in Scripture were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med immediately by God himſelf, or by his Angels. And then having cited ſeveral anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, who thought it the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that appeared, he adds, <hi>Sed Theologis jam illa ſententia placet, quae ſtatuit Angelorum miniſterio antiquis hominibus oblatam eſſe divinam ſpeciem, quae eſt ſententia Dionyſ. de caeleſt. Hier. c.</hi> 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Lorinus</hi> another Jeſuit ſpeaks in <hi>Act.</hi> vii. 31.</p>
               <p>But this is not the worſt of it that they forſake the judgment of the Ancients; they do herein make bold to contradict the plain words of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 18. Chriſt ſaith thus, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten who is in the boſom of the Father he hath declared him.</hi> And parallel to this Text is <hi>Joh.</hi> vi. 46.

               <p>Away then with ſuch Divines who ſetting aſide the Authority of Chriſt, do chuſe to Theologize in the principal Heads of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the ſenſe and prejudices of the Moderns.

               <p>As to the ſecond Queſtion it would be no Queſtion at all, but for the obſtinacy of ſome latter <hi>Jews.</hi> He that reads the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text without prejudice, cannot but ſee the <hi>Elohim</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 15. is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the following verſe, whence it follows that this Redeeming Angel is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe this opinion is contradicted by ſome of the chief Modern <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Abarba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> and <hi>Alſhek</hi> on this place, and by moſt of the Popiſh Divines, as well as ſome few of the Reformed, that have not ſifted this matter accurately, we will offer ſome proofs for the conviction of them that are not obſtinately bent againſt it.</p>
               <p>And, 1. If <hi>Jacob</hi> had had two Perſons then in his mind ſo different as God and a created Angel are, he would have coupled them together by the particle ז, which is not only conjunctive, but very proper to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Perſons of whom we ſpeak, and ſaid, God before whom my Fathers walked, God who fed me from my youth, and the Angel that delivered me, bleſs the Lads. But <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſo far from doing thus, that on the contrary he puts a ה demonſtrative as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angel as before God, without any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulative between, which ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, he means the ſame Perſon by God and the Angel. <hi>Munſter</hi> was well aware of this, and therefore being willing to diſtinguiſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Angel from God, he Tranſlates it with an addition, the <hi>Angel alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:93550:234"/>2. It cannot be eaſily ſuppoſed, That <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> would in a Prayer uſe the Singular Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in common to Perſons, in Nature ſo very different, the Creator and a Creature. He certainly ought to have ſaid, God and the Angel, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may they bleſs the Lads, if he had ſpoken of two. But his ſpeaking in the the Singular, may <hi>he bleſs,</hi> is an Argument of his having in his Eye one Perſon alone, whoſe Bleſſing he prayed for on his Seed. Otherwiſe it would have been a Prayer of a ſtrange Compoſition. For according to <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> we do no where find that one prays to God and the Angel, or any other created Being at the ſame time for any thing. Nor is there any like inſtance of ſuch a Form as this, God and an Angel give thee this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ſetting aſide thoſe Rules with which the contrary Opinion can never be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, conſider the thing it ſelf in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prayer, and you will find it abſurd to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the Offices of God, and thoſe of a created Angel toward <hi>Jacob.</hi> The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice aſcribed to God, is feeding him from his Youth; the Office aſcribed to the Angel, is delivering him from all Evil; which muſt be very diſtinct Offices, if the Perſons be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed. And ſo <hi>R. Jochanan</hi> accounts them, <hi>Gem. Peſaſch. f.</hi> 118. Tho he believes the Angel to be the ſame with <hi>Elohim,</hi> yet he contends that feeding, the greater Work, is attributed to God; and delivering, the leſſer Work, to an Angel. The ſame thing is ſaid by the Author of <hi>Jalkut</hi> on this place; and <hi>R. Samule</hi> on the Book <hi>Rabboth</hi> abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. But in the Phraſe of theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:93550:234"/> this Diſtinction is very inſipid; it is harſhly formed, without conſidering that <hi>Jacob</hi> in this Bleſſing reflected on the Words of the Vow which he made at <hi>Luz,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Bethel,</hi> becauſe of God's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him there. Now, theſe were the Words of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Vow, <hi>If God will be with me, and keep me in the way in which I ſhall walk: if he will give meat to eat, and cloathing to put on, and bring me home in ſafety to the houſe of my Father, then ſhall the Lord be my God,</hi> Gen. xxvii. 20, 21. Here you ſee it is from God that <hi>Jacob</hi> expects to be kept in his way, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be redeemed from all Evils that might happen, and that he eſteems this to be no leſs a benefit than Suſtenance or Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he mentions in the ſecond place. Here is no Angel ſpoken of here; and ſince the redeeming Angel is to be expounded from this place, he cannot be a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, for here is no other ſpoken of, but the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By fancying him a created Angel, who delivered <hi>Jacob</hi> from all Evil, they make <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to be a mere Idolater, as aſcribing that to a Creature, which belongs only to the Lord of the Creation. The Scripture appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates to God the Title of Redeemer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; nor do godly Men ever ſay of a Creature, that it delivers them from all Evil. <hi>David,</hi> I am ſure, never does, but when he ſpeaks of <hi>the Tribulations of the Righteous;</hi> he adds, but the Lord delivers him out of all, <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxxiv. 20. And <hi>Jacob</hi> on another occaſion, directs his Prayer to the Lord that appeared to him at <hi>Luz,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Save me from the hand
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:93550:235"/> of my brother Eſau, for I fear him much,</hi> Gen. xxxii. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God, as I ſaid, has ſo appropriated the Name of <hi>Redeemer</hi> to himſelf, that <hi>Jacob</hi> could not without Sacriledge communicate this Title to any Creature, though never ſo excellent. We cannot be ignorant, that <hi>David</hi> makes this the proper Name of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xix. 14. as does <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> xliii. 14. xlvii. 4. And this <hi>Jonathan</hi> confeſſes on <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxiii. 16. in theſe words, <hi>Thou art our redeemer, thy name is from everlaſting, i. e.</hi> this is the Name that was deſigned for God from the beginning, which yet can't hold true; if in this place, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlviii. 16. it be aſcribed by <hi>Jacob</hi> to a created Angel.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It appears plainly from <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. that <hi>Jacob</hi> neither deſired, nor expected any Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a created Angel, but only from God. Thus he prays, <hi>&amp;c. The God of thy Father ſhall be thy helper, and the Almighty ſhall bleſs thee with the Bleſſings of Heaven above,</hi> &amp;c. Not a word of a mere Angel that redeemed him from all Evil; ſo far was the Patriarch in his former Bleſſing, from begging of an Angel the Multiplication of his Seed, which was the only thing which he could now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of God, as the <hi>Jews</hi> own. <hi>Bechai Praef. in Pent. f.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſame Concluſion may be drawn from the very Order of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prayer. Had <hi>Jacob</hi> intended a created Angel by him whom he names in the laſt place as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer from Evil, and whoſe Interceſſion with God he beſpeaks in behalf of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, would he not have prayed to the Angel
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:93550:235"/> in the firſt place? It is moſt rational ſo to do. He that wants the Intereſt of a great Man to introduce him to the King, he does not in the firſt place direct his Petition to the King immediately, but firſt to the great Man, and afterwards by him to the King. Let the Papiſts therefore look to the Abſurdity of their proceeding, while they firſt pray to God, and then to Saints and Angels. Let thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who are of the mind of <hi>Iſaac Abarbanel</hi> and <hi>Franco Serrano,</hi> in his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Notes on this place, and ſtickle for Angel-worſhip, ſee how they can clear themſelves of this difficulty, as well as reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with thoſe ancienter <hi>Jews,</hi> who abhor this ſort of Idolatry. <hi>Maim.

               <p>How firm theſe Reaſons are, to ſhew the Angel here ſpoken of to be an uncreated, and not a created Angel, is I hope evident to every one. Something however of great importance may be ſtill added to illuſtrate this weighty Argument, and that is the Judgment of the Ancient Synagogue. The moſt ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, and they that received the Traditionary Doctrine from them, though mortal Enemies of the Chriſtian Religion, yet agree with the Chriſtians in the Senſe of this Text. For, God be thanked, ſuch Truths were not renounced all at once by theſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Faith, but they began to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them by degrees, as they found them turning againſt them in their Diſputes with the Chriſtians.</p>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:93550:236"/>
               <p>To begin with the Writings of the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt, we find it is <hi>God</hi> the Word, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. who is deſcribed as he that delivers from all Evil, in the Book of <hi>Wiſd.</hi> xvi. 8. no doubt with reſpect to this place, where he takes the Angel that delivered <hi>Jacob</hi> from all Evil, to be God.</p>
               <p>The ſame Doctrine is to be met with in <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> that lived before Chriſt, and in Chriſt's time. He<note n="*" place="margin">Allegor. <hi>ii.</hi> p. <hi>71.</hi> D.</note> expreſly affirms of the Angel that delivered <hi>Jacob</hi> from all Evil, that he was the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. And ſo does <hi>Onkelos</hi> in his <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, tranſlating the Words of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſimply, as they lie in the Text, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Addition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jonathan</hi> indeed ſeems to be of another mind in his Paraphraſe, that runs thus, God before whom my Fathers, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> worſhipped, the Lord that fed me from the time I began to be till this day, may be pleas'd that the Angel may bleſs the Lads, whom thou haſt ordained to deliver me from all Evil. Here he diſtinguiſhes the Angel from God; but that he did not mean a Creature by this Angel, is clear, for that in other places he tranſlates this Angel by the Word, or <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Redeeming Angel,</hi> ſaith he, is <hi>he</hi> that anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the time of his affliction, and who ſaid to him, <hi>I am the God of Bethel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>my name</hi> is in him. The like he has on <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. where the appearance in the Buſh is mentioned: <hi>This is he of whom it is ſaid, and God called Moſes out of the Buſh.</hi> He is called an Angel, becauſe he Governs the World; for it is written in one place, And <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that is, <hi>the Lord God, brought us out of Egypt;</hi> and in another place, <hi>He ſent his Angel and brought us out of Egypt.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:93550:237"/> 
                  <hi>The Angel of his Preſence ſaved them, viz.</hi> that Angel who is the face of God, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>My face ſhall go before you.</hi> Laſtly, that Angel of whom the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> mentions, <hi>And the Lord whom you ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple, even the Angel of the Covenant whom you deſire.</hi> At length he adds, The face of God is God himſelf, as all Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters do acknowledge; but no one can rightly underſtand this, without being inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Myſteries of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Menachem</hi> of <hi>Rekan.</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> xlviii. 16. the ſame that afterwards commented on the whole <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> was no ſtranger to this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Saith he, He means the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> when he ſpeaks of the Redeeming Angel, <hi>f.</hi> 52. See alſo <hi>f.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p>The like has <hi>R. Bechai,</hi> the famous <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writer, whoſe Comments are conſtantly in the hands of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors. He proves that this Bleſſing is not different from that which is afterwards repeated, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. where no Angel is mentioned. Whence it follows, that the three terms in <hi>Gen.</hi> xlviii. <hi>God, God that fed me, the Angel that redeemed me,</hi> are Synonimous to the mighty one of <hi>Jacob, Ch.</hi> xlix. which Title the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Prayers do frequently aſcribe to God. <hi>Bech. f.</hi> 71. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>Ed. Rivae di Trento.</hi> He alſo there teaches, that this Angel was the <hi>Shekinah.</hi> As does <hi>R. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Gekatilia,</hi> in his Book called <hi>Saare Ora,</hi> according to <hi>Menaſſeh Ben Iſrael q.</hi> 64. <hi>in Gen. p.</hi> 118. <hi>Aben Sueb</hi> on this place, a Man of Name among his Party, writes much to the ſame purpoſe on this place.</p>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:93550:237"/>
               <p>Theſe are followed by two Eminent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Cabaliſts.</hi> The one in his Notes on <hi>Zohar, f.</hi> 122. toward the end, ſaith, <hi>the Angel that delivered me from all evil, is the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinah,</hi> of whom <hi>Exod.</hi> xiv. 19. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord, which went before the camp of Iſrael, removed and went behind them, and may God bleſs us in the age to come.</hi> The other is he who contracted the <hi>Zohar</hi> on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and is called <hi>R. David</hi> the leſs. He in that Book <hi>Ed. Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonic. f.</hi> 174. profeſſes to follow the opinion of <hi>R. Gekatalia</hi> in his <hi>Saare Ora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor does <hi>Menaſſeh Ben Iſrael</hi> himſelf much diſſent from theſe in the above-mentioned place. For though he attempts to reconcile <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 16. with the firſt Commandment, <hi>Exod.</hi> xx. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me,</hi> by ſaying it was the opinion of ſeveral of their Maſters, that there was no contradiction between them; yet at length he produces the opinion of the <hi>Cabaliſts,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of his Readers, who poſſibly would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in his former reaſon drawn only from Modern Authorities.</p>
               <p>I mention not <hi>R. Levi ben Gerſom</hi>'s opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who denies the Angel here ſpoken of to be a Creature, but calls him the <hi>Intellectus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens,</hi> becauſe he ſeems to have borrowed the Notion from the <hi>Arabian</hi> Philoſophers; nor is it commonly received by thoſe of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Many others might be added to theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Teſtimonies, but what I have already produced is I think very ſufficient.</p>

               <p>Having thus ſhewed the Opinions of the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> concerning <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Angel, and that to this day the Tradition is not quite worn out that exalts him above a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; I now proceed to the third Queſtion, the clearing of which will fully juſtifie that Opinion of the Ancients concerning this Text.</p>
               <p>And that is, Whether this form of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, be not an expreſs Prayer? The ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt part as well of <hi>Jews</hi> as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do agree, That we can't worſhip Angels without Idolatry. This <hi>Maimonides</hi> affirms, as I quoted him above; and the Proteſtants, as all Men know, do abhor this Idolatry in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>I do therefore poſitively aſſert, That theſe words contain a Prayer to the Angel, as well as to God, for a Bleſſing on his Children. This the <hi>Jews</hi> can't gain-ſay, ſince <hi>Jonathan</hi> their Paraphraſt, and other Writers after him, do commonly term this Bleſſing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or a Prayer And for this reaſon <hi>R. Menaſſeh</hi> thought it neceſſary to endeavour to reconcile this Prayer of <hi>Jacob</hi> with the firſt Commandment, which forbids Angel-Worſhip according to the <hi>Jews</hi> Interpretation. <hi>R. Menach. de Rek. in Pent. f.</hi> 97. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>It is true <hi>Jacob</hi>'s form of Bleſſing does ſeem to proceed from him either as a Wiſh, or a Prophecy: A Wiſh, as if he had ſaid, Would to the Lord, God and his Angel would bleſs the Lads. A Prophecy, as if he had
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:93550:238"/> foretold that God and his Angel ſhould in after-times fulfill what he now wiſhed. But it might be both Wiſh and Prophecy, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be a direct Prayer to God and the Redeeming Angel. 'Tis well known how the <hi>Jews</hi> commonly delivered their Petitions to God in this form. And yet I can't forbear giving one inſtance to confirm it. You may read it in <hi>Deut.</hi> vi. 22, <hi>&amp;c. And the Lord ſaid to Moſes, ſaying, Speak to Aaron and his Sons, thus ſhall you bleſs the children of Iſrael, and ſay, The Lord bleſs thee, and keep thee;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Lord make his face ſhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. And they ſhall invoke my name for the children of Iſrael,</hi> (ſo our Tranſlation is to be mended) <hi>and I will bleſs them.</hi> So that in plain terms the form of Bleſſing here preſcribed by God, is called <hi>Invocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot therefore ſee what ſhould hinder, but that we after <hi>Jacob</hi>'s example may offer up our Prayers to a created Angel, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as ſome do, that <hi>Jacob</hi> prayed for a Bleſſing to such a kind of Angel.<note place="margin">De Sanct. Beat. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>29.</hi> Corn. A Lap. <hi>on</hi> Gen. <hi>xlviii.</hi>
                  </note> It is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others of his Communion draw from this inſtance: Holy <hi>Jacob</hi> invoked an Angel, therefore it is not unlawful for the pretended reformed to do the like; therefore one may worſhip o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides God; theſe things, ſaith he, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, unleſs you reckon Prayer to be no act of Worſhip, not peculiar to God alone.</p>
               <p>But let them of his Church get out of theſe difficulties as they can, who believe <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Angel to have been a meer Creature. Let
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:93550:239"/> them try how they can convince a <hi>Socinian</hi> from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 2. and other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where Worſhip is aſcribed to Chriſt. The <hi>Socinian</hi> has his anſwer ready, he may wiſh and pray to Chriſt for Grace, though he be not God, ſince he does no more than <hi>Jacob</hi> did, when he prayed for a Bleſſing on his Children to a meer Angel.</p>
               <p>I am more concerned for theſe Divines of the Reformed Church, who have given the ſame Interpretation of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Angel, with the Generality of Papiſts, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant, they therein diſſent from the Divinity of the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Fathers of the Chriſtian Church, and even the more Learned and candid <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Maſius</hi> was; I might add, (which perhaps they have not conſidered) though they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contradict the whole ſtrain of the New Teſtament. See <hi>Mercerus ad Pagnini Lexicon, p.</hi> 1254.</p>
               <p>The intended ſhortneſs of this Treatiſe will not permit me to enlarge on this Head. However one thing I muſt not paſs over, which is worthy the examination of the leſs cautious Divines. It is very certain, that the God that appeared to <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel</hi> was the very God that fed <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Deſert, and againſt whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs did rebel. Now the Apoſtle is expreſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. that he was Chriſt, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Wilderneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and not a meer Angel. The Apoſtle takes it for granted, it was a thing undiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Synagogue in his time. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unleſs this be allowed, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:93550:239"/> in this Chapter is trifling and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>Well! what can <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſay to this? he who aſſerts a created Angel to be ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlviii. 16. He has forgot what he ſaid on that Text when he is come to this place. He here ſtrenuouſly urges it againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to prove that Chriſt was then in being when the <hi>Jews</hi> tempted him in the Wilderneſs. And ſince hereby he owns that Chriſt in his Divine Nature was he that led <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Wilderneſs, who is ſometimes called God, and ſometimes an Angel, he inconſiderately grants what he had denied before, that the Angel who redeemed <hi>Jacob</hi> from all evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Angel that conducted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was alſo God.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>SECT. VI.</head>
               <p>You ſee what Contradictions <hi>Bellarmine</hi> falls into, out of his zeal to promote the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Invocation of Saints.</hi> I wiſh there were not ſomething as bad in our Divines that carries them in the like Contradictions. The beſt I can ſay for their excuſe is only this, They have not carefully attended to the Stile of Holy Scripture. Two or three things therefore I will mention, which occur fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture, that methinks would have ſuggeſted higher thoughts of this Angel to one that conſidered what he read.</p>
               <p>He that conſiders how often our Lord Chriſt is called in the New Teſtament, <hi>the Spouſe, or Husband of the Church,</hi> and compares it with the ſame Title that God appropriates
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:93550:240"/> to himſelf under the Old Teſtament Eſtate, will make little doubt that it was the ſame Chriſt who was then married to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> By the ſame rule one may infer, that our Lord Chriſt in calling himſelf a Shepherd, had a reſpect to that Title, by which he is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aſcribed in his dealings with <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſterity. This the ancienter <hi>Jews</hi> were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and therefore both here, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlviii. 15. and <hi>ch.</hi> xlix. 24. where God is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Shepherd, they underſtand it of the <hi>Shekinah</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>R. Menachem de Rekanah</hi> from the Book <hi>Habbahir in Pent. f.</hi> 84. <hi>c.</hi> 2. Of this alſo the <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſt's time were not ignorant, who hearing Chriſt in one of his Sermons likening himſelf <hi>to the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> Joh. x. did preſently apprehend that he would be thought the Meſſias, and therefore took up ſtones to ſtone him. And then in the proceſs of his Diſcourſe to maintain this Character, he made himſelf one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt called himſelf a Shepherd, to ſhew that he was the God that had fed <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſterity like ſheep; ſo alſo is Chriſt moſt frequently repreſented in the New Teſtament under the Notion of a Redeemer; intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby that he was the ſame Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel of whom <hi>Jacob</hi> had ſpoken. It was he that was called<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. lxiii. 9.</note> the <hi>Angel of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> by whom God redeem'd his ancient People: And he is alſo called the <hi>Angel of the Covenant</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Mal. iii. 1.</note>, in the promiſe of his coming in the time of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhould have put an end to this Tract, but for two Objections that lye in my
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:93550:240"/> way, and ſeem to require ſome kind of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>The firſt is taken from the <hi>Jews</hi> who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them expound this Redeeming Angel by <hi>Metatron,</hi> and <hi>Metatron</hi> according to them, being a created Angel, or as ſome ſay, no other than <hi>Enoch</hi> that was Tranſlated; there ſeems to be as many Authorities againſt us as for us.</p>
               <p>But let it be obſerved, 1. Though the <hi>Jews</hi> have ſeveral Names of Angels which are not mentioned in Scripture, yet they are all form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Names of God, according to the Rules of their <hi>Cabala,</hi> and that with reſpect to the Ten <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> has noted, <hi>Lex. Talm. p.</hi> 828.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is plain from the word <hi>Actariel,</hi> which is at the head of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> forms of Excommunication<note n="*" place="margin">v. <hi>Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locci, f.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 450.</note>. This is derived from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the Name of the firſt of the Ten <hi>Sephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth,</hi> whence the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> place <hi>Actariel</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, <hi>Beracoth, f.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh him from the Miniſtring Angels that ſtand before the Throne. But I refer the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reader that would know more of this to the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Book Intituled, <hi>Berith Menucha, c.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is no leſs plain of the Angel <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> who as they ſay was he that diſcourſed with <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> iii. and the Angel in whom God placed his Name. So that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though it is framed from the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, yet it expreſſes the ſame that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does as <hi>R. S. Jarchi</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii. confeſſes. Now St. <hi>Hierome</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> i. 24. notes, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:93550:241"/> ſometimes render God's Name <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which leads us into the meaning of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Jews</hi> that accounted <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Metatron</hi> to be the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Generality of <hi>Jews</hi> are ſo far from believing <hi>Metatron</hi> to be <hi>Enoch,</hi> that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be the Meſſias, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> before his Incarnation, in our phraſe, but in theirs, the Soul of the Meſſias, which they look on as ſomething between God and the Angels, whom nothing ſeparates from the Living God. See <hi>Reuchlin, l.</hi> i. <hi>de Cabala, p.</hi> 651. where he proves <hi>Metatron</hi> to be the Meſſias from their Writings: Or in ſhort, take the confeſſion of <hi>Menaſſe ben Iſrael, Q.</hi> 6. <hi>in Gen.</hi> §. 2.</p>
               <p>And truly if one would compare all thoſe places of the Old Teſtament that mention the Angel, whom the later <hi>Jews</hi> call <hi>Metatron,</hi> he would find ſuch Properties belonging to this Angel, as are incommunicable to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this ſhews that they who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in this point from the Tradition of their Fathers, did it on this ground, becauſe they were loth to acknowledge the Divinity of the Meſſias, which ſeemed to be clear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on allowing <hi>Metatron</hi> to be the Meſſias. They were more careful to defend their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, than the Opinions of the Ancients.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another Objection is made from the place in <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 4. the words are theſe, <hi>John to the ſeven Churches that are in Aſia, Grace be to you, and peace from him that was, and is, and is to come, and from the ſeven Spirits that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Throne; and from Jeſus Chriſt, who is the faithful witneſs, &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>John</hi> here ſeems to wiſh and pray for Grace, not only from the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:93550:241"/> Father, but alſo from the Seven Angels that are before the Throne of God, and ſo to be reckoned among the Miniſtring Spirits.</p>
               <p>This place is indeed abuſed by thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, to ſhew that Prayers may be lawfully directed to Angels. And the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves have contributed to lead ſome Men of Note into the miſtake. For, beſides the four chief Angels, whom they make to preſide over the four Armies of Angels, which they have chiefly grounded on <hi>Ezek.</hi> i. they ſpeak of ſeven other Angels, that were created before the reſt, and that wait on God before the Vail,<note place="margin">R. Eliezer, <hi>in</hi> capit. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> that divides them from the <hi>Shechinah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The hearing of theſe things ſo often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> has given occaſion, I ſay, to ſome conſiderable Divines to believe thoſe ſeven to be proper Angels, whom St. <hi>John</hi> mentions in his <hi>Revelation.</hi> But then not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending how Prayers could be offered to them, nor why the precedency is given them before Chriſt, they would not have <hi>John</hi> here to have ſpoken a Prayer, but only to have wiſht Grace on the Seven Churches; and this they thought a ſenſe conſiſtent enough with the Angel-worſhip forbidden by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. ii. 18. and even in this very Book, <hi>Revel.</hi> xix. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> xxii. 9.</p>
               <p>But to ſhorten this matter, I altogether deny that St. <hi>John</hi> intended here any created Angels. What then did he mean by them? Nothing elſe but the Holy Spirit, for whoſe moſt perfect Power and Grace on the Seven Churches he here makes Supplication. For as <hi>Cyril</hi> on <hi>Zech.</hi> iii. 9. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. The Number ſeven is always a mark of Perfection in the thing to which it is applied. St. <hi>John</hi> therefore thought of no alluſion to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> opinion of ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, when he prayed for Grace from the Seven Spirits before the Throne; but had in his mind to expreſs the far more plentiful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and more powerful efficacy of the Holy Spirit under the Goſpel than under the Law, and his never ceaſing Miniſtration for the good of the Church, for which purpoſes he hath received a Vicarious authority under God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Chriſt, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>de Praeſc.

               <p>St. <hi>John</hi>'s way of expreſſing himſelf is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from <hi>Zech.</hi> iii. 9. where God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as having ſeven Eyes running through the Earth, to ſignifie by this Figure God's perfect knowledge of all things, as <hi>Cyril Alexandrinus</hi> Notes. Hence we read of Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> iii. 1. <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God.</hi> And in another place ſeven Eyes, and ſeven Horns are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him. But we never read (which is worth our obſervation) of theſe ſeven Spirits, as we do of the four Beaſts, and twenty-four Elders, that they fell down and Worſhipped God.</p>
               <p>But why does St. <hi>John</hi> put the Holy Spirit before Chriſt? If I ſhould ſay St. <hi>Paul</hi> has done the like in <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 1. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> v. 5. to teach us the unity and equality of each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Bleſſed Trinity, or becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> in the following Verſes was to ſpeak more at
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:93550:242"/> large of Chriſt, I think I ſhould not anſwer improperly. But I ſhall add another reaſon, which may explain the whole matter.</p>
               <p>In a word, I do believe this difficulty muſt be reſolved another way; for that which makes this place ſo intricate according to the judgment of many Interpreters, is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the Father, the words of the 4th. verſe, <hi>Grace be unto you, and peace from him, which is, and which was, and which is to come;</hi> which ought to be referred particularly to Chriſt himſelf, who is deſcribed, <hi>Chap.</hi> iv. <hi>v.</hi> 8. according to the deſcription of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 39. But then ſome will ſay, Why is there any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the ſeven Spirits, if we conceive that the Grace which is asked for the Church, in the firſt words, is asked from Jeſus Chriſt? The thing is ſo clear, that <hi>Socinus</hi> has perceiv'd it.</p>
               <p>Now ſeven Spirits are here mentioned, to denote the Spirit of God, which was to reſide with his ſevenfold Gifts in the Meſſias, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> xi. 2, 3. and from thence it comes, that in <hi>Revel. ch.</hi> v. 6. the Lamb is deſcribed having ſeven Horns, and ſeven Eyes, which are the ſeven Spirits of God, ſent forth into all the Earth. To Chriſt there are attributed ſeven Horns, which denote his Empire, in oppoſition to the Empire of the little Horn, which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 8. So there are ſeven Eyes, which are the ſeven Spirits of God, attributed to him; likewiſe, to denote the Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Jeſus Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt, and that in oppoſition to the little Horn, in which there were Eyes, <hi>Like the Eyes of man, Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> vii <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:93550:243"/>
               <p>Here then <hi>the Grace asked,</hi> is from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits, that is, from the Holy Ghoſt, who is united in one with the Meſſias Jeſus Chriſt, and is ſent by him; and ſo it is ſaid to be asked from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who both has thoſe Spirits as his Eyes, and does cauſe the Miſſion of them to his Church.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> therefore doth not place the Holy Spirit before Chriſt, but mentions him with Chriſt, becauſe he after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, and during the time of Chriſt's continuance on God's right hand, has a more particular hand in the immediate Government of the Church, and is eſpecially watchful to do her good. And for this reaſon I think it is, the Holy Spirit is placed as it were without the Veil, like a Miniſtring Angel. Many of the Ancients knew this, as <hi>Victorinus Petavionenſis, Ambroſe, Beda, Arethas, Autpertus, Walafridus Strabo, Haymo, Rupertus,</hi> from whom <hi>Tho. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi> and <hi>Caelius</hi> of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> who rebukes thoſe that underſtand it otherwiſe, and other Elder Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church learnt it, to ſay nothing of thoſe of the Reformed Church: But it is time to give over.</p>
